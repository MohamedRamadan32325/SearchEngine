motorists fear left stranded cannot find charging points electric vehicle increasing range priority car firms Credit Getty Images One biggest barriers electric vehicles distance travel single charge manufacturers shedding weight cars squeeze miles batteries seems like simple enough choice widespread use electric vehicles could trigger potential positive tipping point efforts limit global warming many motorists still choosing make switch low carbon technology decision meant electric vehicle uptake rapid slower car manufacturers anticipated many reasons consumers moving electric vehicles quickly expected including price charging infrastructure concerns far travel – called range anxiety Drivers want able charge go time takes fill tank petrol diesel want mileage per charge battery according Achyut Jajoo senior vice president general manager manufacturing automotive customer relations management software firm Salesforce recently surveyed 2 000 drivers consumer preferences today lithium ion batteries EVs go far Consumer Electronics Show CES Las Vegas Nevada US week signs auto companies looking innovative ways overcome obstacles adoption particularly North American market solution Make cars lighter Every ounce weight reduction improves range says Andrew Poliak US chief technology officer Panasonic Automotive company says developed components – speakers audio system used cars – weigh 30 60 less also draw 60 less power car without affecting performance electric vehicles using lightweighting technology like wiring harness hold wires place reduction technologies technological advancements amplifiers algorithms used make audio system sound good put bear bring really nice sound system actually reducing amount power drain says battery technology also ability charge faster less susceptible heat related damage fast charging CES 2023 Panasonic showed two inch 5cm speakers fit car dashboard able produce sound typically made larger six inch 15cm speakers door

EVs wrong China buses shaping world EV revolution promise batteries come trees Another major car manufacturer Honda looking different key component electric cars effort shed weight – battery making substantial investments developing solid state batteries smaller lighter conventional lithium ion batteries currently standard electric vehicles road today battery technology also ability charge faster less susceptible heat related damage fast charging brings added benefits says Honda spokesperson Chris Martin worry battery overheating means may need safety features around offering another way lightweight car add weight vehicle means need bigger battery attain range says Martin cascading effect vulnerability lithium ion batteries remove vulnerability reduce vehicle weight put batteries new locations wanted keep vehicle way could theoretically take crash structure protecting battery – people – put battery Getty Images Lithium ion batteries currently bulky add considerable weight vehicles impacts range Credit Getty Images EVs certainly saw mixed year 2023 demand private users UK fell company fleet orders global predictions suggested continued exponential rise uptake manufacturers warned rapid growth set slow lighter weight components could also help bring cost vehicles think inevitable technology advances capital costs electric vehicle go says Poliak question
