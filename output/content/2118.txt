hit pollen longer season due rising temperatures global warming also triggering alarming extreme allergy events say experts People could see thunderstorm see going inside Trillions pollen particles sucked clouds storm formed splintered rain lightning humidity ever smaller fragments – cast back Earth people breathe around 18 00 21 November 2016 air Melbourne Australia turned deadly Emergency service phone lines lit people struggling breathe began flooding hospitals much demand ambulances vehicles unable reach patients stuck home Emergency rooms saw eight times many people turning breathing problems would normally expect Nearly 10 times many people asthma admitted hospital total 10 people died including 20 year old law student passed away lawn waiting ambulance family tried resuscitate One survivor described breathing normally within 30 minutes found gasping air insane told reporters hospital bed Paul Beggs environmental health scientist professor Macquarie University Sydney Australia remembers incident well absolutely massive event Unprecedented Catastrophic says people Melbourne doctors nurses people pharmacies – know happening soon became clear massive case thunderstorm asthma occurs certain types storms break pollen particles air releasing proteins showering unsuspecting people widely dispersed proteins trigger allergic reactions people – even among previously asthmatic Getty Images strong updrafts downdrafts thunderstorms whip pollen air ahead Credit Getty Images Thunderstorm asthma events like one hit Melbourne one extreme example pollen plants allergies causes dramatically altered climate change temperatures rise many regions – especially US Europe Australia – seeing seasonal allergies affect increasing proportion people longer season worse symptoms say scientists year US pollen levels predicted higher historical average across 39 states season likely get worse years come experts warn Pollen essential ever present part world microscopic particles pass plants enabling reproduce plants spread pollen help insects others rely wind sending huge volumes powdery substance airborne Many trees grasses weed species rely upon wind dispersal pollen especially likely cause seasonal allergies hay fever occurs immune system mistakenly identifies pollen harmful substance triggering response normally reserved pathogenic bacteria viruses Common symptoms include runny nose itchy eyes sneezing cases seasonal allergies trigger breathing difficulties inflammation airways leads swelling making hard get enough air lungs Every time cranked carbon dioxide ragweed responded evidence producing allergenic form pollen – Lewis Ziska Melbourne unlucky epicentre thunderstorm asthma seven thunderstorm asthma major events recorded since 1984 similar incidents occurred around world Birmingham UK Atlanta US Although still rare events climate change may increasing likelihood thunderstorm asthma incidents part extending pollen seasons also increasing frequency extreme weather events including storms possible determine exactly much climate change influenced 2016 thunderstorm asthma incident Melbourne Beggs reasonably certain impact know climate change leading greater amounts pollen atmosphere says changing seasonality pollen changing types pollen exposed Beggs researched thunderstorm asthma extensively published paper 2024 examined links phenomenon climate change thunderstorms supercharge pollen Exactly thunderstorms trigger exacerbate asthma way still fully understood leading theory cold air downdrafts occur thunderstorm weather systems generate strong cross winds blow ground level whipping pollen grains fungal spores grass plants get carried high storm system updrafts moisture clouds causes swell break apart smaller fragments massively increasing number allergen particles air strong electric field develops thunderstorms may also enhance rupture pollen smaller particle size makes easier pollen fragments get airways carried back ground level cold draft winds Pollen levels seem spike first 20 30 minutes thunderstorm according studies phenomenon Younger people seem particularly affected Thankfully major thunderstorm asthma events remain rare climate change increasing people risk pollen exposure ways one thing rising temperatures mean pollen seasons – plants emit pollen typically spring summer – starting earlier lasting longer says Elaine Fuertes public health scientist focuses environment allergic disease National Heart Lung Institute Imperial College UK going get people experience symptoms earlier year longer period time says parts world including US Europe one key culprits ragweed – widespread group flowering plants many people consider weeds various species ragweed around world produce mind bending amounts pollen single plant capable emitting one billion pollen grains example Ragweed grows gardens farmland also nooks crannies urban environments Allergies ragweed pollen already affect 50 million people US alone study analysing data 11 locations North America 1995 2015 found 10 locations experienced longer ragweed pollen seasons – sometimes much longer 20 year period season lengthened 25 days Winnipeg Manitoba 21 days Fargo North Dakota 18 days Minneapolis Minnesota winter warms springs starting earlier falls delayed time spend outdoors contact allergic pollen definitely going says Lewis Ziska associate professor environmental health science Columbia University New York US one scientists researched ragweed pollen season changes get drastic northern parts North America Europe Asia Ziska says also Australia southern parts South America Africa Without immediate cuts greenhouse gas emissions effect likely get worse One 2022 study example estimated end century pollen seasons begin 40 days earlier end 15 days later – potentially meaning additional two months symptoms hay fever sufferers per year Alamy Ragweed plants major source pollen allergies parts world efforts get rid Credit Alamy people exposed allergens longer also amount allergens air increasing many parts world 2000s pollen season continental US started three days earlier 1990s crucially amount pollen air also 46 higher partly carbon dioxide CO2 levels atmosphere rising due emissions human activities many bothersome plants hay fever sufferers thrive CO2 researchers grew certain type grass different CO2 levels example found plants grown atmosphere containing CO2 800 parts per million ppm flowers produced 50 pollen plants grown air containing 400ppm latter mimics current levels CO2 Earth atmosphere Similarly scientists also experimented growing different types oak tree pollen often causes hay fever countries South Korea 720ppm CO2 scenario found oak tree average pollen count 13 times trees 400ppm scenario Even 560ppm pollen production 3 5 times higher current levels like • Meet Siku itchy polar bear allergies • light pollution disrupts plants senses • science probiotics skin Ziska authored 2022 book Greenhouse Planet ran similar experiments ragweed results mirror researchers Every time cranked carbon dioxide ragweed plants responded grew produced pollen says evidence producing allergenic form pollen one could induce immune system respond even greater extent past spread invasive species across new parts world also triggering allergic reactions new populations people originally North America ragweed example spread across Europe well Australia Asia South America Already 60 people Hungary 20 Denmark 15 Netherlands reportedly sensitive pollen prolific group plants Getty Images amount pollen air increasing due climate change scientists predict seasonal allergies also worsen Credit Getty Images makes especially concerning 2050 concentration ragweed pollen air estimated four times today Even parts Europe ragweed pollen virtually absent present including southern UK Germany pollen loads become substantial moderate high end climate scenarios researchers wrote 2015 study one third increase due continuing spread invasive species researchers note remaining two thirds specifically due climate change including lengthening growing season temperatures warm earlier season longer season well intense season experience allergic symptoms – higher risk new sensitisation previously unexposed population Fuertes says every region world see pollen production researchers found southern California example experience earlier less productive pollen seasons largely result reduced rainfall predictions account potential effects climate change airborne allergens could also health impacts increased likelihood wildfires example raises risk asthma allergy symptoms Relatively speaking amount pollen air still vary year year Fuertes points may much help hay fever sufferers sensitised go develop allergic symptoms still likely experience symptoms years pollen levels may lower average says react pollen around people Cutting carbon emissions would help avert worst climate impacts strategies might also mitigate problem might possible make drastic direct interventions example century ago US cities even set commissions tackle ragweed Chicago employs 1 350 hay fever fight blares one headline 1932 news story explains men – otherwise unemployed Great Depression – paid equivalent one week food lodging 25 cents cash day spent cutting plant Getty Images Planting tree species produce less allergy inducing airborne pollen one way cities help sufferers Credit Getty Images might sound quaint made difference 1956 study New York City Operation Ragweed estimated cutting plant droves cut pollen production 50 Today Europe find coordinated action ongoing Berlin workers dispatched find eliminate ragweed around city Switzerland banned import sale plant 2024 established volunteer groups patrolling public parks pull solutions lie smarter urban design definitely green cities Fuertes says need thoughtfully Planting exotic species example trigger new allergies Opting male pollen producing trees species messy fruit seed producing female ones – called botanical sexism – also increase pollen levels urban areas although studies shown effect bias relatively small major cities New York also important monitor forecast pollen levels scientists say need know breathing pretty fundamental thing terms health says Beggs points people take granted get reliable real time validated information metrics like temperature rainfall area relatively say airborne allergens even services modelling pollen counts extensive detailed way – Finnish Meteorological Institute – monitoring modelling airborne allergen levels accurate pollen grain release different amounts allergens vary weather conditions different measurement Fuertes points one shown closely linked allergy symptoms Nobody measuring allergen levels routine basis Fuertes says moving towards Overall experts say science clear Without concrete coordinated action climate change continue make hay fever worse across many regions world might include dramatic deadly events like thunderstorm asthma might also mean people sniffling suffering longer season
