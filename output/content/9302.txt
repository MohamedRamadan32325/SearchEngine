Green energy See latest updates British startup Drift Energy wants build boats equipped underwater turbines — say would first ever class mobile renewable energy DRIFT Energy boat seen artist

system generates electricity multiple leaf like turbines produced French company New World Wind Courtesy FRED TANNEAU AFP Getty Images Powering ships using wind hardly new idea wind increasingly used power huge cargo ships Pyxis Ocean ship chartered Cargill embarked maiden voyage August 2023 Fitted two WindWings large steel sails designed UK company BAR Technologies ship could see emissions savings 30 BAR Technologies French company Airseas developed Seawing said could help ships cut carbon emissions average 20 Airseas since bought Japanese shipping company K Line Pictured Seawing tested

button – making easy ship enter harbor pass bridge Michelin Rotors – vertical cylinders spin wind create forward motion – another type wind propulsion technology deployed cargo ships 2018 Finnish company Norsepower installed two rotors 800 foot long Timberwolf formerly Maersk Pelican tanker first year operation fuel savings 8 recorded Norsepower Floating wind farms capable producing energy solar panels onshore wind Described world first semi submersible floating offshore wind farm located coast Viana Castelo northern Portugal WindFloat Atlantic commissioned 2020 Miguel Riopa AFP via

significantly recent years accounts 8 world’s energy production end decade second largest renewable source solar surpassed hydropower according International Energy Agency Wind turbines efficient solar panels — harness average 50 energy goes compared 20 solar — dependent location Offshore turbines benefit stronger winds efficient land also expensive build maintain UK wind power generation 2024 largest energy source first time startup called Drift looking extract even power offshore wind effectively chasing — racing yacht “We make renewable energy ocean using sailboats deliver energy ports across globe ” says Drift’s founder CEO Ben Medland Drift built two prototypes 17 feet 5 meters length first demonstrated 2022 Sail GP sailing league Plymouth harbor UK Sail GP race 2022 Drift unvelied prototype flying yachts called Whispers measuring 17 feet 5 4 meters length DRIFT Energy high performance catamarans equipped hydrofoils lift water well underwater turbine looks like propeller works opposite way capturing energy vessel sails water renewable energy fed device called electrolyzer converts seawater hydrogen gas stores aboard ready offloaded used clean fuel power industrial processes cars planes ships “This first ever class mobile renewable energy ” Medland continues “It doesn’t need grid infrastructure doesn’t need cables ocean doesn’t need foundations anchors anything like ‘free range’ wind turbines ” 24 million yacht Humans used wind propel ships millennia wind powered vessels renaissance method decarbonize global shipping Drift aims go one step “Our company’s philosophy simple — can’t ship produce renewable energy rather using energy move water ” One key component Drift’s technology algorithm hunts Medland calls “Goldilock conditions” — wind strong enough generate energy without dangerous “The Goldilocks algorithm sails 6 million virtual miles 0 02 seconds choose next mile optimized route — kind data wasn’t available 10 15 years ago ” says “When add together onboard technology you’ve got what’s effectively fishing boat energy ” artist impression showing Drift first commercial vessels could look like DRIFT Energy prototypes produce kilowatts power comparable small urban wind turbine Drift working new design 1 5 megawatt range comparable larger wind turbine 300 feet 91 meters height water “in next two years” commercial models derive ships 190 feet 58 meters long produce 330 000 pounds 150 000 kilograms hydrogen gas per year capacity would still lower average newly installed turbines US 3 2 megawatts 2022 Medland says ships higher efficiency compared wind turbines meaning potential would “more equivalent three four megawatt turbine seven megawatt solar park ” cost first ship prohibitively high around £20 million 24 million due amount research development go scale decrease “single digit millions ” Medland says adding estimates Drift could get initial orders 40 vessels Drift vessel sea shown artist impression DRIFT Energy Drift sail international waters locations North Atlantic Caribbean ships bear country flag meet maritime standards Initially crewed aim make autonomous ships six crew need offload hydrogen port week average every 10 days optimal weather away shore operated behalf Drift’s clients Medland says likely mainly heavy industries island nations wanting increase power output maritime transport companies including cargo cruise ship operators looking alternative fuels says first commercial fleet make hydrogen cheaply “if connect electrolysis unit grid UK ” parity cheapest hydrogen made fossil fuels achieved 2030 Drift says vessels wouldn’t limited making hydrogen could also modified produce green ammonia green methanol could also power board data centers carbon capture even help ocean exploration “Our ships move around little bit like butterfly garden ” says Medand “It looks random it’s actually efficient ” means could also generate gathering data parts ocean rarely accessed helping weather models mapping marine life Lateral thinking Academics field renewable energy transport involved Drift expressed cautious optimism technology approached CNN comment “Our ships move around little bit like butterfly garden looks random it’s actually efficient says Drift CEO Ben Midland Charles Sturge Making hydrogen generation mobile instead static “impressive lateral thinking ” according Tristan Smith professor Energy Transport University College London says lack availability new energy commodity real problem needs creative innovative solutions challenge key question Smith adds whether Drift’s solution compete terms cost point consumption relative ways producing transporting hydrogen fuels made ammonia Autonomous energy harvesting vessels suggested past says Alasdair McDonald professor School Engineering University Edinburgh Scotland points designs proposed past Scottish engineer Stephen Salter meant harvest energy sea artificially brighten clouds combat climate change currently French firm Farwind makes rotor sails add wind propulsion cargo ships also developed design meant store wind energy onboard hydrogen John Hammond director research UK’s Pirbright Institute Ingrid Weel Related article ‘cow fart’ vaccine could help tackle climate change general principle extracting wind energy far offshore reasonably sensible McDonald says “Wind speeds get higher go shore water depths become challenging existing wind turbine designs distance cables means cost losses autonomous energy harvesting vessels become route accessing energy source ” However according Simon Hogg professor Department Engineering Durham University England new technology type needs sold advantage offshore renewable energy technologies could prove challenging modern wind farms consist hundreds turbines 8 15 megawatt range ever increasing efficiency Drift’s value also dependent upon hydrogen becoming major energy source adds yet certain says challenges around scaling technology integration shipping sea users means best suited “very specialized applications hydrogen generation remote locations ” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad
