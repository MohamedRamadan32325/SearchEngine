whether eruption imminent something else going Michael Sayles Alamy Stock Photo Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — volcano rise dead Uturuncu lofty peak Central Andes mountain range what’s known “zombie volcano ” hasn’t erupted 250 000 years nonetheless shows signs activity similar seen active volcanoes gas plumes earthquakes Satellite radar imagery taken two decades ago Uturuncu — tallest mountain southwestern Bolivia — showed forces inside volcano lifted lowered region near summit measuring 93 miles 150 kilometers wide creating shape like sombrero Scientists recently took closer look Uturuncu see whether ongoing deformation activity signs slumbering volcano might waking combining satellite data analysis seismic activity computer models rocks respond different pressures researchers pieced together clearer picture Uturuncu’s inner “anatomy” uncovered cause unrest reported findings April 28 journal Proceedings National Academy Sciences Volcanic eruptions typically occur magma volcano surges subsurface pockets called magma chambers escapes surface vents fissures Eruptions explosive magma thicker trapping gases pressure builds suddenly releases forcefully expelling magma lava wasn’t case Uturuncu according study Rather magma gases briny fluids interacting hydrothermal network — system activities fully understood — produce volcano’s zombie rumblings remote uninhabited Simushir Island located Kurils source previously unidentified 1831 eruption Oleg Dirksen Related article ‘Mystery volcano’ erupted cooled Earth 1831 finally identified ‘Letting steam’ Beneath Uturuncu depth 6 12 miles 10 20 kilometers lies vast reservoir magma called Altiplano Puna Magma Body Spanning roughly 124 miles 200 kilometers biggest known active magma body planet’s crust Prior studies hinted active hydrothermal system linking magma reservoir mountain range unknown magma fluids interacting within network Using signals 1 700 seismic events 2009 2012 scientists produced high resolution images shallow crust Uturuncu also recorded electrical gravitational shifts underground changes rock chemistry revealing never seen details channel system beneath within volcano circulated geothermally heated fluid researchers found magma body heated subterranean liquid released gases gas liquid migrated upward collected chambers volcanic crater movement Uturuncu triggered quakes released steam deformed volcano’s rock causing surface rise 0 4 inches 1 centimeter per year Uturuncu’s internal dynamics explain activity also suggest zombie won’t reviving time soon said study coauthor Dr Mike Kendall professor head department earth sciences University Oxford “We’re seeing seismicity increasingly rising bad sign would increase seismicity seismicity that’s starting migrate great depth much shallower depths — that’s usually indication magma move ” Kendall told CNN “We’re seeing anything like ” said “It looks like it’s volcano degassing letting steam calming anything ” fragment organic glass found inside skull deceased individual Herculaneum Pier Paolo Petrone Related article young man’s brain turned glass eruption Mount Vesuvius Scientists say figured Using multiple techniques key part bringing Uturuncu’s subsurface structure focus according geologist Dr Benjamin Andrews director Global Volcanism Program Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum Natural History Washington DC isolation methods investigating seismic activity rock chemistry physics “would give interesting somewhat ambiguous results ” said Andrews involved study Together methods point hydrothermal system rather surging magma cause Uturuncu’s activity provide snapshot interplay magma rock fluid volcanoes “This research importance understanding volcanoes granitic rocks ore bodies formation continental crust ” Andrews said email also important recognize volcanoes quite active “but necessarily primed eruption ” Dozens zombies Another “zombie volcano” interest scientists Campi Flegrei located west Naples Italy also shown signs unrest erupted since 1538 Salvatore Laporta KONTROLAB LightRocket Getty

gases escape ” said study coauthor Dr Matthew Pritchard professor geophysics Cornell University New York Uturuncu one many dozens zombie volcanoes scientists tracking worldwide new findings could help identify zombies risk erupting zombies show elevated surface temperatures already explored potential sources geothermal energy well mineral deposits “but many ripe investigations ” Pritchard told CNN

turns cave dwelling spiders ‘zombies’ Peering volcano’s internal plumbing could reveal possible targets harnessing geothermal energy accessing metals essential technologies copper nickel platinum Kendall added combination methods could useful analyzing type volcano — zombies “It’s really good way better understanding anatomy volcano stage development ” said “That’s important risk hazard
