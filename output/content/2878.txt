framework agnostic code centric recommendations examples building GEL design patterns websites illustrate create websites comply BBC guidelines industry best practice giving special emphasis BBC Accessibility Guidelines websites guides BBC developers following BBC GEL design patterns including BBC employees contractors suppliers However publicly available anyone may interested BBC recommends building websites use guides Open Government Licence Public Sector Information Details found National Archives website examples guide reference intended used library Coding conventions guides make
