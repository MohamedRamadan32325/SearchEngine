referred lungs earth store billions tonnes carbon help reduce impacts climate change one half trillion trees measuring exactly much carbon store virtually impossible Tuesday European Space Agency ESA successfully launched first kind satellite uses special radar system reveal lies beneath canopy hoped help scientists better understand importance rainforests storing carbon impact deforestation World leaders promise end deforestation 2030 Deforestation surges 2022 despite pledges rocket took ESA Kourou station French Guiana flying Amazon one rainforests study satellite board affectionately named space brolly giant 12m diameter antenna send signals really want interrogate forests actually look inside Prof John Remedios director National Centre Earth Observation proposed idea ESA said launch said would major achievement actually know first time high accuracy much actually Amazon Congo Indonesia antenna using P band radar long wavelength allowing see deeper inside forests reveal branches trunks obscured canopy radars space today take wonderful images icebergs look forests see tops forest little twigs little leaves penetrate forests explained Dr Ralph Cordey head geosciences Airbus found using much longer radar wavelength could see depths trees forests said 1 2 tonne satellite use approach dissimilar used CT scan analyse slices trees repeat passes build picture much woody material present material used proxy amount planet warming carbon dioxide stored Currently scientists measuring individual trees trying extrapolate presents huge challenge said Prof Mat Disney professor remote sensing University College London current understanding really patchy really really difficult measure said Essentially talking trying weigh amount carbon stored one half trillion trees across tropics Satellites really way consistently ground measurements continue take place satellite launched verify data sending back ESA CNES ARIANESPACE Artwork 1 2 tonne Biomass satellite deploy umbrella like reflector antenna satellite built UK first conceived University Sheffield academic Professor Shaun Quegan said international effort mission culmination decades highly innovative work partnership best scientists Europe US Despite decades testing deployment satellite many challenging stages beyond rocket launch Certain things satellite big includes big 12 metre deployable antenna bit like deploying umbrella space big one looking happen smoothly said Dr Cordey Airbus brought engineers American company L3Harris Technologies site Stevenage oversee construction antenna reflector L3Harris specialists large unfurlable systems expertise currently possessed Europe L3 Harris Technologies Europe bought American expertise large reflector antennas team hoping produce first maps within six months continue gather data next five years annual maps show much carbon stored much lost deforestation kind observations 50 years satellites like Landsat affected heavily clouds tropical regions clouds lot time may see chunk tropical forest said Prof Disney Another advantage longer wavelength Biomass satellite penetrate clouds giving consistent comparable view forest one year next outcome motivated scientists worked project 20 years exciting going tell us something perhaps take granted said Dr Cordey forests trees contributing processes govern planet particular processes
