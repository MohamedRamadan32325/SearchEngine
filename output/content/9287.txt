region includes Yosemite National Park seen George Rose Getty Images Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — Seismologist Deborah Kilb wading California earthquake records past four decades noticed something odd — series deep earthquakes occurred Sierra Nevada depth Earth’s crust would typically hot high pressure seismic activity “In Northern California usually earthquake data goes 10 kilometers 6 miles Southern California they’ll go little bit deeper 18 kilometers 11 miles ” said Kilb researcher Scripps Institution Oceanography University California San Diego referring depths earthquakes usually occur regions earthquakes found taking place near central region mountain range twice deep — appear ongoing “The fact see seismicity that’s 20 kilometers 12 4 miles — like 20 kilometers 40 kilometers 25 miles — odd ” Kilb said “It’s something would typically see crustal earthquakes ” Kilb flagged data Vera Schulte Pelkum research scientist Cooperative Institute Research Environmental Sciences associate research professor geological sciences University Colorado Boulder Schulte Pelkum already studying Sierra Nevada’s peculiar rock footprint shown deep rock deformations within area Steven Miller Related article mysterious ocean glow reported 400 years stumped scientists new study could offer clues Using newfound data researchers imaged Sierra Nevada technique known receiver function analysis uses seismic waves map Earth’s internal structure scientists found central region mountain range Earth’s crust currently peeling away process scientifically known lithospheric foundering Kilb Schulte Pelkum reported findings December journal Geophysical Research Letters hypothesis lined previous speculation area undergone lithospheric foundering happens Earth’s outermost layer sinks lower layer mantle study authors believe process ongoing currently progressing north mountain range according study “We compared notes realized strange rock fabric arrangement rocks signals strange deep earthquakes area ” Schulte Pelkum said “So decided look closely found whole story ” What’s happening Sierra Nevada could offer rare insight continents formed Schulte Pelkum said finding could also help scientists identify areas process happening well provide better understanding earthquakes planet operates added continents formed Earth’s uppermost layer lithosphere made rigid crust top part mantle denser fluid state layer also contains Earth’s oceanic crust — thinner denser layer oceans — continental crust sits layer sublayers manage exist ideal state continents top something mystery Schulte Pelkum said “The continents happened sticking current sea level luckily us … they’re made less dense minerals average ” Schulte Pelkum said “To make sit higher first place get rid dense stuff ” Reconstruction late Maastrichtian 66 million years ago palaeoenvironment North America floodplain roamed dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex Edmontosaurus annectens Triceratops prorsus Davide Bonadonna Related article dinosaurs headed extinction even massive asteroid strike Scientists offer new clues Lithospheric foundering process denser materials pulled bottom less dense material emerges top resulting land creation “It’s dumping denser stuff gooey solid mantle layer underneath sort basically detaching stops pulling less dense stuff ” explained Within imaging Earth Sierra Nevada researchers found distinct layer within mantle 40 70 kilometers 25 43 miles deep layer specific imprints gradually changed due north data showed one block clay spots different colored clay throughout squeezed clay hands spots would start turn stripes — similar rock deformations appear Schulte Pelkum said southern Sierra dense rocks strongest inherent stripes shown already sheared away crust whereas central region process appears ongoing northern Sierra currently signs deformation distinct layer within mantle would also explain deep earthquakes Kilb found crust central region unusually thick pulled also colder hot mantle material typically found depths “Rock takes really long time warm cool move stuff know pulling pushing takes adjust temperature ” Schulte Pelkum said Steven Businger video Related video two people see exact rainbow Here’s Evidence process hard come visible ground it’s extremely slow process Scientists theorize south Sierra finished process lithospheric foundering 4 million 3 million years ago according study appears natural events happen occasionally around world Schulte Pelkum said “Geologically speaking pretty quick process long periods stability … lithosphere foundering probably started happening long time ago started building continents continents gotten bigger time it’s sort punctuated localized thing ” added Ongoing debate Sierra Nevada topic debate decades geology community due anomaly found within mantle located underneath Great Valley scientists believe lithospheric foundering caused feature scientists think may caused subduction oceanic plate sinks beneath less dense plate continental crust changes landscape said Mitchell McMillan research geologist postdoctoral fellow Georgia Tech involved study “There really two competing hypotheses explain data don’t really get often geology … paper going add whole discussion really neat way ” said study within area could also help scientists better understand Earth evolves long timescales lithospheric foundering continues underneath mountain range one speculate land continue stretch vertically changing way landscape looks McMillan said could take anywhere several hundred thousand million years added general large mountain belts anywhere batholith expect find events McMillan said Andes long mountain range South America example another place scientists speculate lithosphere foundering occurred could still happening today added HAAD SAI KHAO TRAT PROVINCE THAILAND 2017 12 28

showed life Earth could started found new possibility “I think study particular highlights importance tying together different datasets ” McMillan said better understanding process scientists learn functions planet happens beneath surface including occurrence earthquakes linked process McMillan said Separately planet Venus plate tectonics like Earth evidence lithospheric foundering events understanding process Earth start apply Venus said “It’s really fascinating think could … hiking Sierra foothills even anywhere else continent know there’s stuff going really deep underneath we’re aware ” Schulte Pelkum said “We sort owe existence land processes happening Earth hadn’t made continents we’d different creatures … evolved planet evolved way sort understanding whole system you’re
