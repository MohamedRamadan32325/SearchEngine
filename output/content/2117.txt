autism – decades proven elusive scientists starting uncover clues 1970s prevailing belief psychiatry autism consequence bad parenting 1940s Austrian psychiatrist Leo Kanner coined controversial refrigerator mother theory suggesting autism arose early childhood trauma created mothers cold uncaring rejected children Daniel Geschwind neuroscience genetics professor University California Los Angeles UCLA says rightly recognised deeply damaging wrong – took better part three decades Kanner theory debunked 1977 couple psychiatrists carried landmark study demonstrating autism often runs identical twins nuanced accurate picture autism origins began emerge 1977 study first time genetic component autism identified Research since shown one identical twin autistic likelihood twin 90 Meanwhile chances fraternal twins sex sharing diagnosis autism around 34 levels substantially higher typical rate occurrence among wider population around 2 8 widely accepted strong genetic component autism genes involved expression influenced factors starting unravelled Tiny differences Even twin study 1977 would take several decades full subtleties interaction autism human genome become apparent two individuals amount genetic variation around 0 1 meaning approximately one letter base pair every 1 000 DNA different Sometimes variations effect says Thomas Bourgeron neuroscience professor Institut Pasteur Paris Sometimes little effect sometimes super strong effect Currently super strong variations identified 20 cases autism single mutation single gene largely responsible driving critical neurodevelopmental differences role single gene mutations arise one heavily studied areas autism research Bourgeron explains often result severe life limiting disabilities Getty Images autistic people neurodiversity thought arise combined action thousands different gene variants Credit Getty Images like autism see movies Bourgeron says born one major mutations high likelihood end intellectual disability motor delay ability coordinate muscle groups epileptic encephalopathy major impact quality life family cases far scientists identified least 100 genes mutations occur Bourgeron made one first discoveries March 2003 identified two gene mutations linked autism impacted proteins involved synaptogenesis process forming connections neurons brain major breakthrough although barely made ripple media time Bourgeron recalling former US President George W Bush recently declared war Iraq discoveries come including mutations Shank3 gene estimated occur less 1 people autism know mutations known de novo variants means occur random chance developing embryo present blood DNA either mother father Geschwind describes de novo variants akin bolt lightning unexpected rare However cases mutations passed one parents even appear neurotypical complex phenomenon researchers begun understand past decade might wonder autistic child inherited rare gene mutation one parents parent autism says Geschwind seems happen parent sufficient causal child major gene mutation combines additively less individually impactful gene variants drive neurodevelopment differences says course also thought environmental factors involved development autism – even among identical twins one diagnosed 10 time one Historically identifying environmental factors behind autism led pseudoscientific beliefs idea – widely debunked – certain vaccines might involved US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr pledged massive research effort identify causes autism September 2025 includes hiring vaccine sceptic David Geier data analyst US Department Health Human Services Autism Society America expressed concerns plans unrealistic well potentially harmful misleading According US National Institutes Health NIH potential non genetic causes autism include prenatal exposure air pollution certain pesticides extreme prematurity birth difficulties leading oxygen deprivation baby brain among factors Early development Today genetic research leading progress neurodevelopment lead autism appears many genes become functional formation cortex – wrinkly outer layer brain responsible many high level functions including memory problem solving thinking critical part brain development occurs foetus developing womb according Geschwind peaks somewhere 12 24 weeks think mutations disrupting normal patterns development knocking development normal track speak maybe onto another tributary instead normal neurotypical pattern development says Geschwind cause severe disability information gene mutations enabled parents form support groups example FamilieSCN2A Foundation serves community families autistic children autism diagnosis linked genetic change SCN2A gene Discussions also held regarding idea using genetic information influence future reproductive decisions de novo variant tell parents risk would low another child neurodevelopmental challenges limited contribution inherited factors decided subsequent children says Geschwind also give family sense spectrum child might develop time parents two year old non verbal walking delay want know expect offer huge benefits families concept genetic research viewed universal positivity across autistic community Autism vast spectrum ranging severe impairments physical mental development never allow live independently others far fewer support needs view autism identity advantage oppose depictions autism disorder Getty Images many people autism part broad spectrum human experience – something treated Credit Getty Images autistic people families number academic researchers compilation genetic data yielded ongoing concerns might used complex picture past half century genetics studies shown majority autistic people neurodiversity arises additive effects hundreds even thousands relatively common gene variants inherited parents gene variants exist throughout population neurotypical neurodivergent people individual contribution one genes neurodevelopment negligible combination significant effect wiring brain Bourgeron says uncommon one parents carry gene variants display autistic traits preference order difficulties detecting emotions hyperaware patterns unlike child traits manifest significant degree could diagnosed autistic last 20 years autism researchers devised ingenious ways identifying subtle variants early 2000s Simon Baron Cohen professor psychology psychiatry University Cambridge colleagues devised test called Reading Mind Eyes intended assess person ability detect emotions looking playful comforting irritated bored – based photograph shows person eyes idea poorer performance test indicates higher likelihood person autistic Autistic individuals different way looking face seem get information person mouth says Bourgeron Neurotypical individuals get information eyes recently partnership DNA testing site 23andMe agreed host Reading Mind Eyes test website Bourgeron Baron Cohen able gather data abilities 88 000 people read thoughts emotions person eyes compare performance genetic information dataset able identify large groups gene variants associated poorer emotion recognition many thought carried autistic people research studies found common gene variants associated autism tend negatively correlated empathy social communication positively correlated ability analyse construct systems well rules routines intriguingly also often linked higher educational attainment along greater spatial mathematical artistic abilities perhaps explains genetic variants come distant ancestors remained population throughout human history says Geschwind Geschwind Baron Cohen embarking project try understand whether common gene variants linked autism explain autism seems prevalent men autistic women thought adept masking neurodivergent traits compared autistic men likelihood differences male female brain development function make men susceptible women protected genetic susceptibility autism degree fully understand yet says Geschwind However experts believe autism may much common women currently thought experiences group overlooked Autism biological phenomenon tested get categorical outcome prognosis – Sue Fletcher Watson Geschwind suggests understanding sex differences autism could help identify protective factors could used future treatments yet concept remains deeply divisive reflective one core underlying tensions within autism research scientists pursue treatments researchers autistic people believe autism disorder fixed identity shared experience Autism biological phenomenon tested get categorical outcome prognosis says Sue Fletcher Watson professor developmental psychology University Edinburgh something like cancer universally agreed bad everyone wants cure opinion never particular Fletcher Watson says many autistic people fear ultimate outcome autism genetic research prenatal test could pose existential threat autism Beginning 2005 one activist created Autistic Genocide Clock stating test existed would represent continuation historic attempts eliminate minority groups Two decades later fears remain Genetic researchers whole done little listen address fears autistic community regarding security future use genetic data says Fletcher Watson fears heightened political contexts says strength certain far right parties make possibility eugenic use genetic data seem much real Prenatal tests already established practice UK conditions caused extra copy chromosome body’s cells include syndrome extra copy chromosome 21 Edward syndrome extra copy chromosome 18 Patau syndrome extra copy chromosome 13 countries like Iceland termination rates following positive screen close 100 says broad spectrum Joseph Buxbaum psychiatry professor Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai founded Autism Sequencing Consortium international group scientists share samples genetic data feels autistic activists missing point get challenged somebody says Well autism think need researched like Well somebody language IQ 50 never able live alone unsupervised says Buxbaum thoughts person think interventions thinking people opposed someone trouble maintaining eye contact unusual interests conflicts social situations Getty Images Scientists starting uncover many gene variants associated autism Credit Getty Images Geschwind agrees also citing marked differences exist across autistic spectrum majority spectrum condition accommodated like disability says However adds another cohort – severely impacted – would warrant treatment different things says try better stratify broad spectrum autistic traits Lancet Commission formally recognised term profound autism 2021 way describing autistic people unable advocate likely require 24 hour support throughout lives Since variety clinical trials begun using various therapeutic strategies try target single genes underpinning physical intellectual disability different individuals profound autism main idea treatments surrounds fact us two copies alleles variants every single gene one parent recent study Geschwind lab leveraged understanding de novo gene mutations linked profound autism knock one copies suggesting might possible reduce degree disability boosting unaffected copy means one unaffected copy activity showed could turned compensate says Geschwind Bourgeron recently running clinical trial using metal lithium boost version Shank3 gene autistic children known Shank3 mutations future Geschwind suggests technology Crispr allows scientists edit person DNA could used intervene even earlier stage life example gene therapy could delivered unborn babies found various mutations still womb recently figured way says might fully correct impacted gene could least partially correct FDA recently granted approval US based biotechnology company Jaguar Gene Therapy run clinical trial gene therapy administered autistic children Shank3 gene mutation along co occurring genetic condition called Phelan McDermid syndrome affects development speech behaviour trial possible children participating genetic diagnoses says Buxbaum researchers Mount Sinai elsewhere spent past 15 years studying children develop mutations use natural history data control study trials could undoubtedly result enormous benefits children involved families Fletcher Watson still sceptical depiction therapies autism profound otherwise would prefer see characterised treatments intellectual disability believe people talk single gene cases autism disingenuous says Fletcher Watson talking single gene causes intellectual disability perhaps many also autistic funding available research address autism active parent campaign groups sorts resources way intellectual disability time Fletcher Watson optimistic potential genetic research devise novel treatments co occurring conditions autistic people often diagnosed including epilepsy sleep disturbances OCD gastrointestinal disorders Bourgeron coordinates European project risk resilience developmental diversity mental health collaborating autistic people families better understand autism rarely comes isolation makes different individuals prone conditions time Bourgeron says also need better recognise neurodiversity reduce stigma relating autism think us geneticists need go back needs person says autistic
