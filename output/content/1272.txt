Earth one ever taken human Fifty years new images planet reveal visible changes Earth surface tell said astronaut Harrison Schmitt Apollo 17 hurtled towards Moon ever fragile appearing piece blue space Earth right Thursday 7 December 1972 humanity got first look planet whole moment photograph Blue Marble taken – one changed way saw world see lights southern California Bob said Schmitt ground control one half hours flight Man field stars Earth competing heavens crew Apollo 17 – commander Eugene Cernan command module pilot Ronald Evans lunar module pilot Harrison Jack Schmitt – watching home recede distance journeyed space last manned mission Moon strings holding either – Eugene Cernan Looking back towards Earth Cernan commented clouds seem artistic picturesque clockwise rotating fashion… appear be… thin can… see clouds blue water enduring image beauty also vulnerability planet – adrift vastness Universe hosts signs life able detect date also planet great change tectonic movements shift landmasses move slow eyes notice Yet another force – humanity – reshaping planet pace see Urbanisation deforestation pollution greenhouse gas emissions altering way Earth looks 50 years since iconic image taken Blue Marble changed Nasa crew handed camera taking photographs throughout journey Moon Credit Nasa first images Blue Marble taken crew passed onboard camera – hand held analogue Hasselblad 500 EL loaded 70mm Kodak film – captivated sight Earth space images captured Hasselblads spectacularly clear bright says Jennifer Levasseur curator Smithsonian National Air Space Museum Washington DC camera specially modified use space adds Glues lubricants moving parts batteries could cause problems fail exposed extremes hot cold space also given large square shutter release button crew could use wearing cumbersome spacesuits major modification removal viewing screen – extra glass Levasseur says astronauts learn take pictures without able see anything says Without viewfinder see taking Nasa Clouds swirl blue seas captured crew Apollo 17 second pass Africa continuing Moon Credit Nasa Taking photos says Levasseur planned meticulously written mission plan known previous launches give whole Earth one whole Earth would entirely illuminated light Sun around five hours 20 minutes flight crew got first glimpse entire planet crew starting get ready bed zipping sleeping bags first moment downtime since launch suppose seeing 100 full Earth ever see said Cernan Bob kind views stick forever… strings holding either Blue Marble image captured around 29 000km 18 000 miles Earth Sun lit globe behind Apollo 17 ancient Egyptian geographer Ptolemy Nasa see Earth Almost six hours flight Schmitt laughed problem looking Earth particularly Antarctica bright said using sunglasses monocular Back home nearing 05 00 Johnson Space Center Houston Texas ground control quiet keeping awake Bob asked Schmitt keep talking listening came voice capsule communicator conversation continued long flight crew describing clouds drifting ocean continents home Previous Apollo missions snapped Earth partly hidden shadow hugely influential Earthrise instance shows planet rises behind Moon point view home fragmented real way visualise planet entirety Read Earthrise sparked environmental movement Nasa original slide film 1972 Blue Marble carefully stored Nasa Johnson Space Center Credit Nasa Suddenly glowing light Sun Earth revealed beautiful shining blue orb full life alone vastness space result Blue Marble thought influence humanity photograph history see something hard visualise exists says Nick Pepin climate scientist University Portsmouth UK think us brought image young age probably find difficult imagine time know Earth looked like first time could actually look back space see home – people suddenly realised amazing thing also fixed system live image offers view Earth Mediterranean Sea area Antarctica South polar ice cap Heavy cloud hangs Southern Hemisphere almost entire coastline Africa seen Nasa officially credits image entire crew may never know actually took today reported one reproduced images time Nasa Even exploring Moon Apollo 17 crew made sure take photos home Credit Nasa 07 39 GMT 7 December 2022 – 50 years later minute since original taken – new Blue Marble captured satellite orbiting million miles away time set 12 images taken 15 minutes apart reveal noticeable changes planet surface result 50 years global warming 50 years separates two snapshots time one striking differences visible reduction size Antarctic ice sheet see shrinking cryosphere – shrinking ice sheet loss snow says Pepin says says major indicator climate change Sahara Desert also grown rainforest retreating south adds Research shown tree

million miles away Credit Nasa Epic pictures taken Nasa Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera Epic imaging sunlit side Earth 13 22 times day since 2015 satellite sits first Lagrange point point equilibrium Sun Earth million miles Earth mid April mid October one photograph taken Earth roughly every hour rest year takes image every two hours says Alexander Marshak deputy project scientist Nasa Deep Space Climate Observatory Dscovr satellite mission camera carried aboard respect Blue Marble 50th anniversary decided take images 15 minute intervals 15 minutes Earth rotates around maybe 100km 62 miles says Marshak thanks advances technology adds see images much better quality even million miles away like • Earthrise photo sparked environmental movement • world 11 spacewalks made history • planets aligning really means see much Marshak adds take images 10 wavelengths UV ultraviolet near infrared images retrieve property ozone clouds water height clouds location clouds look property aerosols size particles amount particles retrieve even shape ice crystals clouds using Sun glint see whether horizontally randomly oriented Nasa Epic see Earth different angle original Blue Marble image taken Epic different time year 14 April 2025 Credit Nasa Epic retrieve data amount leaves Earth also amount leaves directly illuminated Sun says Marshak data combined observations ocean surface colour allow researchers determine rate photosynthetic activity Earth Dscovr programme running long enough draw definitive conclusions says Marshak starting gather data provide new insights world changing – changes cloud cover height reflectivity vegetation cover Among changes occurred since first image entire Earth 50 years ago amount human development activity planet surface Although visible

hypothesis developed 1960s 70s proposes Earth biological systems act huge single entity exists delicate state balance although controversial among scientists theory kickstarted holistic approach Earth
