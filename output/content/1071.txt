time help xenon gas climbing medical world worry whether strategy unnecessary gamble Tenzing Norgay Edmund Hillary made first successful ascent Mount Everest 1953 took two months effort reach summit order adjust extreme thin air high altitude team spent several weeks acclimatising working way slowly upwards reaching Base Camp spent seven weeks making brief forays mountain set ropes lay ladders establish ever higher camps assault summit short laid siege mountain Today miles fixed ropes put along route teams Sherpas slick logistics perfected commercial guiding companies allow hundreds climbers summit Everest every year time takes climb Mount Everest changed dramatically since first ascent Many expeditions still recommend allowing around two months reach top extensive acclimatisation although depends range factors including weather traffic mountain fitness climber take week trek Base Camp people need average around 40 days reach summit companies even offer fast track expeditions claim get clients little two weeks season however one guiding company promised slash time even taking clients top world one week starting airport London fly Kathmandu Nepal take helicopter Everest base camp climb mountain days way skip usual painstaking three weeks acclimatisation mountains – around €150 000 £127 000 170 000 per person offer raised eyebrows climbing community came Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach rely unexpected new strategy – inhaling xenon noble gas sometimes used anaesthetic logic behind idea relatively simple Around 10 years ago became apparent xenon one interesting side effect – increases production protein called erythropoietin Known short EPO erythropoietin glycoprotein kidneys produce reaction insufficient oxygen levels EPO fights hypoxia – condition occurs body get enough oxygen – increasing number red blood cells crucial protein carry haemoglobin transports oxygen around body high altitudes process naturally happen multiple rounds going mountain – acclimatisation words – slowly adapt body lower oxygen levels Getty Images climbers undergo extensive acclimatisation high altitude help bodies adapt low levels oxygen Credit Getty Images xenon claimed could potentially offer shortcut inhaling carefully controlled doses gas shortly expedition may possible accelerate effects acclimatisation Furtenbach says successfully tested xenon previous expeditions however little published scientific evidence showing strategy works One recent systematic review scientific research example found conclusive evidence inhaling xenon positive effect action EPO human body Increase erythropoietin nothing says Andrew Peacock honorary professor specialising altitude medicine University Glasgow UK question case really stimulate production red blood cells short period Furtenbach main goal strategy allow climbers summit faster reduce risk caught bad weather avalanches getting sick less time spend mountain safer expedition becomes says like • tall Mount Everest get stops growing • Death clouds problem Everest bodies • Scientists Antarctica began developing accent Furtenbach reputation pushing limits possible Everest specialised offering flash three week expeditions mountaineers pre acclimatise home making trip Everest climbing season 2025 planning use xenon approach help four British clients reach summit early May Many mountaineering community however reacted plans mix scepticism condemnation medical commission International Climbing Mountaineering Federation UIAA – umbrella group mountaineering organisations around world – issued cautionary statement Furtenbach revealed plans warned absence clinical research scientific proof safety efficiency using xenon high altitudes previous assessment body also warned drugs designed induce EPO could potentially increase risk blood clots capable triggering strokes pulmonary embolisms Furtenbach Adventures Lukas Furtenbach hope giving climbers small doses xenon gas ascent reducing amount time spend mountain Credit Furtenbach Adventures climbers also pointed substances artificially increase amount EPO blood – including xenon – banned World Anti Doping Agency Wada competitive sport would use substances mountaineering banned sports says Adrian Ballinger American climber owner rival guiding company Alpenglow Expeditions company guided climber Roxanne Vogel summit Everest 14 days 2019 used altitude chamber gym work help pre acclimatise expedition world commercial guided mountaineering anti doping rules apply clients largely unconcerned

pulmonary brain oedema develop says Burtscher cases capillaries lung brain lose ability retain fluids leaks cells brain lung tissue explains Andrew Peacock consequence loss brain lung function potentially fatal climbers world highest mountains use supplementary oxygen delivered canisters breathing apparatus constant flow gas coming high pressure cylinders mountaineers carry backpacks makes huge difference says Peacock basically mimicking lower altitude makes less breathless improves function heart lungs kidneys liver muscles Hillary Norgay used supplementary oxygen 1953 approach continues today 7 269 people known reached summit Mount Everest 230 done without aid supplemental oxygen mountaineering community however believe supplemental oxygen could also considered doping highly charged debate balancing climber safety ideals pure style mountaineering Piolet prestigious annual award mountaineering tends celebrate ascents achieved without supplemental oxygen example Eager mitigate effects altitude mountaineers doctors willing experiment remedies existing prescription drugs sketchy stimulants 1953 legendary Austrian alpinist Hermann Buhl achieved one greatest feats history mountaineering summiting alone 8 126m 26 660ft Himalayan peak Nanga Parbat remains time anyone managed solo first ascent 8 000m 26 247ft peak Buhl feat considered even impressive without supplemental oxygen gruesome descent famously forced spend night 7 900m 25 919ft standing narrow ledge leaning rock time Buhl already known hard core pioneering alpinist Still unthinkable somebody could survive ordeal later described autobiography however little help backpack form pervitin methamphetamine pills widely used Nazi troops World War Two high altitudes experts agree even acclimatisation body eventually start deteriorate Another stimulant amphetamine often rumoured occasionally used climbers high altitude mountain slopes One study 1993 analysed urine samples taken 253 male mountaineers successful ascent different mountains Amphetamines traces found 7 1 samples climbing 3 300m 10 827ft far popular prescription drug among mountaineers acetazolamide better known Diamox carbonic anhydrase inhibitor used treatment many conditions glaucoma epilepsy also happens quite useful high altitudes accelerates acclimatisation improves sleep says Burtscher Dexamethasone powerful corticosteroid still considered number one life saving medicine cerebral oedema acute mountain sickness since buys time sick person descend research indicated dexamethasone could also useful prophylactic treatment stave acute mountain sickness although medical experts warn result potentially serious side effects recommend use hopes sildenafil commonly known Viagra could also help protect high altitude pulmonary oedema trials shown effective search drugs help give climbers boost performance acclimatisation high altitude never stopped team doctors Willemstad Curaçao example recently
