means 100 situations similar weather rain 20 rain 80 nutshell means whilst may get rain much likely certain stay dry probabilities given location chosen thus valid location MeteoGroup forecasts take advantage hourly updates include real time information radar satellite nearby weather station observations may notice probabilities changing short term next 2 3 hours gives chance spot example shower

measurements working likely weather type based wet weather symbols measurements include hourly rainfall amount well chance rain probability precipitation order generate wet weather symbol needs measurable amount 0 1mm per hour say reasonable chance rainfall expected means light patchy rain drizzle expected may occasions chance seeing least spots rain high high chance rain actual amount expected low less 0 1mm rain one hour would type weather feel spots rain breeze enough dampen roads pavements case weather symbol would remain dry weather symbol e g cloud probability rain could quite high hand shower situations chance rain individual hour might low difficult predict high confidence exact time isolated shower hit particular place occur however strong short downpour therefore predicted amount precipitation high enough generate wet weather symbol despite relatively low precipitation probability feels like temperature mean temperatures forecasts represent air temperature forecast temperature properly shielded thermometer would record However factors lead day feeling hotter colder value alone might suggest two main factors cause sensation wind speed humidity perception temperature comes quickly skin cooled light winds high humidity especially higher temperatures moisture skin slow evaporate cooling lower Thus air may feel somewhat warmer temperature indicates Similarly going way windy dry day especially cold may lead air feeling colder temperature may suggest Thus feels like temperature designed give indication extra factors may combine make apparent temperature seem higher lower indicated course perception temperature rather subjective taken broad guidelines detail keep changing hourly forecast Working weather data provider MeteoGroup provide hourly forecasts 14 days producing forecasts beyond next days MeteoGroup uses weather model information tends towards trends weather rather single deterministic output Small changes conditions

corrected midday purposes forecast day covers period 0600 1800 GMT night 1800 0600 GMT following day Hourly weather symbol symbol appears hourly time step indicates weather expected near relevant location around time indicated example shower symbol appears Wolverhampton 1500 saying chance shower Wolverhampton area close 1500 could one short distance away may actually occur 1430 discrepancies seen maximum minimum temperature given daily summary highest lowest temperatures seen hourly breakdown hourly value given hour whereas max min may occur hourly points may slightly higher lower Maps weather maps produced using MeteoGroup data every three hours whereas text based data refreshes hourly basis meaning map data sometimes lag behind 14 day forecast spot data wind symbol sometimes jump
