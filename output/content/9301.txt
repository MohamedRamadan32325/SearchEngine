Miombo saw decline forest cover almost third 1980 2020 However recent research shed light ability store carbon could mean restoring woodland economic value cutting Double carbon first kind study published July 2024 found Miombo may locking twice much aboveground carbon previously thought difference equates additional 3 7 billion metric tons carbon stored across whole forest — emitted

controversial Rachel Rose Jackson director climate research policy Corporate Accountability — non profit watchdog challenges transnational corporations ethical practices — says Article 6 often serves

Jackson makes clear criticizing Miombo Restoration Alliance specifically says governments must shift away “dangerous distractions like offsets carbon markets” instead focus keeping fossil fuels ground “Much carbon” Disney “forests much carbon ” keeping carbon locked woodland incredibly important climate perspective “says nothing biodiversity ” “food resources shelter aesthetics health benefits
