creation three dire wolf pups raised hopes may possible resurrect extinct animals scientists grave concerns news broke Colossal Biosciences Dallas based biotechnology company resurrected three extinct dire wolves internet reacted awe species last roamed earth 13 000 years ago found recent fame thanks Game Thrones features fictional dire wolves story stoked photograph Game Thrones author George R R Martin holding one adorable white pups released say rebirth direwolf stirred scientific news since Neil Armstrong walked moon Martin wrote blog Martin investor Colossal added extinct species way including woolly mammoth Tasmanian tiger dodo Colossal – currently valued 10bn £7 6bn backed high profile donors Chris Hemsworth Paris Hilton CIA – boldly states website going fix problem extinction According Matt James company chief animal officer aim create Jurassic Park like zoo full extinct animals reintroduce lost species back habitats occupied animals settled Colossal expects exert positive change habitats trying focus species cascading effects ecosystem improve stability lift biodiversity maybe even help climate change buffering James tells BBC De extinction talked decades Colossal three dire wolves – actually grey wolves possess 20 edited genes meant give dire wolf like features – represent serious effort date make lofty vision reality wake dire wolf announcement however many scientists criticised Colossal approach see efforts bring back long extinct species costly wastes resources distraction significant work needed save still living species BBC spoke several experts fields ranging conservation biology paleontology efforts resurrect species extinction whether likely achieve goals Colossal hopes Colossal Biosciences announcement Colossal genetically altered three wolf puppies give dire wolf traits made headlines around world Credit Colossal Biosciences Chief among concerns raised claiming possible bring back extinct species may actually lead existing species lost could give politicians industries idea damage environment fixed resurrecting species message could particularly damaging time US withdrawing international agreements climate change revoking measures intended protect environment wildlife says David Shiffman marine conservation biologist independent consultant based Washington DC beyond irresponsible people Colossal claiming sort conservation victory environment says worry quickly reinforced Doug Burgum US Secretary Interior – Colossal team met advance dire wolf announcement – praised company work X new bedrock modern species conservation Burgum also criticised ineffectiveness endangered species list – presumably reference Red List Threatened Species drawn International Union Conservation IUCN list threatened endangered species maintained branches US Government – thanks characterised focus regulation Since dawn nation innovation – regulation – spawned American greatness wrote Super cool science Biodiversity seemingly endless onslaught threats virtually imposed humans leading reasons according IUCN habitat destruction invasive species overexploitation fishing hunting illegal wildlife trade pollution climate change Colossal claims de extinction work directly benefit conservation company needs tie work ameliorating alleviating reversing something list threats biodiversity says Kent Redford former director Wildlife Conservation Society works independent conservation consultant Portland Maine Colossal de extinction work super cool science continues see alleviating threats highlighted IUCN Colossal sees things otherwise company states website woolly mammoths reintroduced Arctic example increase habitats resilience climate change foraging behavior say help keep carbon locked permafrost ground scraping away snow company says mammoths expose soil cold air causing stay frozen However Nitin Sekar conservation scientist Asian elephant specialist group IUCN says struggled find evidence scientific literature support claim One study comparing carbon storage Arctic tundra taiga forest found soil areas covered trees could store nearly twice much carbon overall slightly found permafrost tundra taiga could find anything else mammoths might affected carbon general Experts dispute claims dire wolf brought back extinction research existing species arctic herbivores suggests reduce permafrost thawing One scoping study researchers University Oxford point role mammoths climate Pleistocene suggests bison horses could replicate role species need maintained high densities – fenced fed managed humans – protective effect Arctic ecosystem also different today Pleistocene also hard say whether mammoth hybrids would effect today landscape species like caribou reindeer could ways mammoths affect carbon levels temperatures increase act trampling scraping away snow could actually accelerate permafrost melting exposing Sun – effect research suggests already happening wet lowlands Arctic Overall data impossible know mammoths affected environment millennia ago mammoth elephant hybrids behave warmer future Sekar says seems like strange thing gamble face existential crisis given alternatives James calls research resolve questions show direct links causation way help bring rest scientific community along journey Dire wolves woolly mammoths driven extinct complex forces changing planet human activities species humans responsible annihilating though simply bringing back help address threats pushed extinction first place says Corinne Kendall programme director Southern Africa Peregrine Fund non profit organisation aims conserve birds prey around world Modern conservationists recognise increasingly focused landscape level solutions rather saving particular favourite species Kendall adds missing way Colossal approaching says address genetics technology side things interesting scientific discovery standpoint creating trees without forest think conservation work Colossal far important de extinction work – Julie Meachen Julie Meachen vertebrate paleontologist morphologist Des Moines University Iowa believes however genetic techniques Colossal used create dire wolves applicable conservation company also exploring ways help still living species northern white rhino elephants endangered pigeons points techniques could applied species suffering genetic diversity loss combat inbreeding genetic bottlenecks low population sizes says think conservation work Colossal far important de extinction work conservation work get press coverage flashy de extinction part adds unfortunate James Colossal agrees de extinction technologies one piece complex puzzle must also include things like habitat protection says attention grabbing headlines extinct species brought back life act like giant ship pulling projects wake Nature nurture also important clear Colossal actually able achieve unlikely ever possible truly resurrect long gone species like dire wolves woolly mammoths say scientists involved company Tissue samples animals extinct tens thousands years lack intact cells needed traditional cloning techniques says Jacquelyn Gill paleoecologist University Maine Colossal engaging genetic modification modern species give physical characteristics make look like extinct species significant technical achievement argues Colossal supporters case dire wolves three puppies managed breed reality genetically modified grey wolves say researchers Essentially genome modern wolves edited replicate small segments ancient DNA obtained fossilised remains dire wolves company admits grey wolves dire wolf characteristics scientists even questioned characteristics unlikely example dire wolves would white Colossal chose make animals white popular conceptions Game Thrones Gill says aesthetic choice biological scientific one Even Colossal bring back animals closely resembled Ice Age species still would bona fide ones lived thousands years ago Pleistocene ecosystem inhabited longer exists Meachen says dire wolf species genes also environment species living Alamy Wooly mammoths extinct thousands years meantime environment lived changed dramatically Credit Alamy Colossal says plans releasing dire wolves wild aspire eventually repopulate parts Arctic woolly mammoths would require engineering lot baby mammoth proxies company plans using Asian African elephants surrogates West especially though people starting question ethics whether elephants – extremely intelligent social sentient beings – kept captivity much less experimented Sekar says Asian elephants modern zoo facilities also frequently suffer infertility lose calves stillbirths infanticides twice often elephants semi wild conditions says mothers deeply mourn dead calves really ok putting elephants visually entertaining animals even real mammoths asks Sekar James says Colossal many quality control steps ensure things go well elephants company also working leading animal welfare experts avoid potential welfare pitfalls ahead Lack returns Colossal disclosed much invested dire wolf programme – likely many millions dollars costs new technologies eventually go scale even de extinction get cheaper still orders magnitude affordable effective stop species going extinct first place Shiffman says Moreover original drivers extinction addressed de extinct species could quickly become extinct warns address genetics technology side things creating trees without forest – Corinne Kendall Redford acknowledges money fungible Colossal primary goal really conservation says hard time viewing work de extinction right investment make every extinct species Colossal bringing back however James says company also investing surviving endangered species Work done introduce greater genetic diversity populations endangered red wolves US example engineer elephants resistant herpes virus red wolves issues genetic diversity biggest threats road collisions human persecution Kendall says Without addressing animal going survive ground genetic component becomes kind irrelevant Herpes also kills fraction number wild Asian elephants year compared killed humans says Sekar reviewed data Indian government causes elephant deaths Around two wild elephants known die per year herpes compared around 100 killed way humans says Colossal could leverage synthetic biology expertise ways clear wins planet experts say Crops engineered efficiently take nitrogen example could huge boon reducing steep climate costs nitrogen fertiliser lessening major dead zones runoffs cause water bodies Finding ways engineer high quality animal proteins human consumption could likewise game changer alleviating many environmental animal welfare concerns plague livestock industry experts say Colossal
