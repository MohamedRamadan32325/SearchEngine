Follow unassuming industrial park 30 miles outside Boston engineers building futuristic machine replicate energy stars goes plan could key producing virtually unlimited clean electricity United States decade donut shaped machine Commonwealth Fusion Systems assembling generate energy simultaneously hottest coldest place entire solar system according scientists building inside extreme environment called tokamak smash atoms together 100 million degree plasma nuclear fusion reaction surrounded magnetic field 400 000 times powerful Earth’s chilled cryogenic gases close absolute zero fusion reaction — forcing two atoms merge — creates energy sun exact opposite world knows “nuclear power” — fission reaction splits atoms Nuclear fusion far greater energy potential none safety concerns around radioactive waste SPARC tokamak Commonwealth says could forever change world gets energy generating 10 million times coal natural gas producing planet warming pollution Fuel fusion abundant derived deuterium found seawater tritium extracted lithium unlike nuclear fission atomic waste involved biggest hurdle building machine powerful precise enough harness molten hard tame plasma also overcoming net energy issue – getting energy put CNN “Basically everybody expects build next machine expect net energy machine ” said Andrew Holland CEO Fusion Industry Association trade group representing fusion companies around globe “The question fast build machine ” Commonwealth’s timeline audacious 2 billion raised private capital goal build world’s first fusion fueled power plant early 2030s Virginia “It’s like race planet ” said Brandon Sorbom Commonwealth’s chief science officer Commonwealth racing find solution global warming Sorbom said it’s also trying keep new power hungry technologies like artificial intelligence “This factory 24 7 factory ” said “We’re acutely aware every minute every hour every day ” Commonwealth Fusion Systems co founder chief science officer Brandon Sorbom poses portrait front company facility Devens Massachusetts Sophie Park CNN Perhaps urgently Commonwealth western companies also racing beat Chinese scientists achieving net energy amid rapid fusion buildout China one enormous facility emerged satellite images Virginia Gov Glenn Youngkin nodded speaking alongside Commonwealth’s CEO Bob Mumgaard March energy conference “China building fusion plants therefore we’ve got get moving ” Youngkin said “There’s race lead world power generation ” fusion safe Fusion science mostly settled hard part maintaining reaction long enough generate electricity tokamaks like one built Commonwealth name game building powerful magnets strong enough contain plasma – superheated cloud charged gas fusion reactions happen Plasma hot light it’s million times less dense air breathe “I won’t call plasma clever there’s intelligence plasma many many ways thwart abilities confine ” Jerry Navratil professor fusion energy plasma physics Columbia University told CNN wall magnets comes restrains unruly plasma diagnostics wall inside tokamak hall Sophie Park CNN Orange stilts one day hold tokamak ground placed throughout tokamak hall Sophie Park CNN Plasma delicate ephemeral — can’t even seen it’s cooled that’s makes safe turned speak easily blowing candle “If blow breath air onto plasma would kill ” Sorbom said “ meteor hits plant ruptures vacuum vessel everything shuts It’s like something like Fukushima Chernobyl there’s runaway chain reaction ” Small mighty Even though tower 30 feet three stories built SPARC tokamak much smaller conventional power plants running coal gas nuclear energy key advantage allow fit power plants future petite compared ITER monster French research tokamak tall 22 story building “ITER big requires things like world’s largest cranes move pieces around ” Sorbom said “This small enough standard equipment move things around – something you’d find auto manufacturing facility don’t invent totally new industrial supply chain everything ” Thus far scientific conventional wisdom bigger tokamak powerful performance Sorbom team disrupted idea new magnet technology magnets big secret weapon unassuming piece thin highly conductive metal tape layered one – maximizing power relatively small space tape carry 200 amps electrical current – much house’s electrical breaker Navratil said SPARC using tested form technology magnetic tokamak However lot questions remain well work “They’re pushing technology places we’ve never obviously entails risk ” Navratil said “Once thing going question surrounding structures withstand kind energy bombardment comes plasma ” person works cryostat base inside tokamak hall Commonwealth Fusion Systems Sophie Park CNN glass wall Devens Massachusetts facility designed build public trust Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ fusion project Sophie Park CNN instance Navratil noted electrical current running magnet something unexpected could sustain damage said first runs SPARC prove magnet technology works would major advancement field “If magnets function expected properly that’ll major step forward ” Navratil said “If that’s actually contributed quite bit development fusion energy ” Beyond technology breakthroughs US also needs think kind supply chains needed breed tritium fuel fusion require access lithium reserves Jean Paul Allain leads US Energy Department’s Office Fusion Energy Sciences told CNN interview last year Chinese particularly adept securing supply chains Allain noted “Access lithium deposits around world high demand ” Allain said “The Chinese establishing Latin America long time precisely they’re looking raw materials ” Powering ‘the next age civilization’ Inside sprawling Houston ballroom March Mumgaard Commonwealth’s CEO spoke hundreds fossil fuel CEOs lobbyists future energy could eventually replace oil gas CERAWeek conference Virginia’s Youngkin also noted keenly interested getting energy wherever find support state’s growing data center industry advanced manufacturing population growth “We need lot power ” Youngkin said “Whoever wins power race going unleash economic opportunity comes quickly ” ventilation system lines ceiling tokamak hall Sophie Park CNN Oil gas companies among investors Commonwealth Fusion fusion startups Holland CEO Fusion Industry Association said “I think energy companies companies want oil companies renewable companies looking fusion ” Holland said “Physically fusion decoupling energy resources something pull ground rely weather makes energy something manufacture ” Sorbom said although thinks fusion could eventually “replace” “whole bunch things ” also sees way provide “way energy everybody ” “One things that’s always excited fusion look quality life metrics get better add energy system ” said Holland emphasized fusion “the next part energy industry ” “And ultimately thing powers humanity kind next age civilization ” Correction story updated better reflect Commonwealth Fusion Systems’
