change climate change Climate change long term shift Earth average temperatures weather conditions world warming quickly past 100 years result weather patterns changing 2015 2024 global temperatures average around 1 28C late 19th Century according European Copernicus climate service external Since 1980s decade warmer previous one UK Met Office says year 2024 world hottest record climate change mainly responsible high temperatures also first calendar year surpass 1 5C warming compared pre industrial levels according Copernicus humans causing climate change climate changed naturally throughout Earth history natural causes cannot explain particularly rapid warming seen last century according UN climate body Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change IPCC caused human activities particular widespread use fossil fuels coal oil gas homes factories transport systems fossil fuels burn release greenhouse gases mostly carbon dioxide CO2 CO2 acts like blanket trapping extra energy atmosphere near Earth surface causes planet heat Since start Industrial Revolution humans started burning large amounts fossil fuels amount CO2 atmosphere risen 50 external far levels seen Earth recent history CO2 released burning fossil fuels external distinctive chemical fingerprint matches type CO2 increasingly found atmosphere effects climate change already seen Climate change already huge effect environment including frequent intense extreme weather heatwaves heavy rainfall rapid melting glaciers ice sheets contributing sea level rise huge declines Arctic sea ice warmer oceans fuel intense storms hurricanes damage wildlife coral reefs changes already serious consequences people economies around world example Hurricanes Helene Milton hit parts US September October 2024 could end costing least 50bn Â£40bn external according provisional estimates 200 people killed Helene least 16 Milton winds rain storms worsened climate change according scientists World Weather Attribution WWA group Back 2022 parts East Africa suffered worst drought 40 years putting 20 million people risk severe hunger Climate change made droughts like least 100 times likely WWA says particular vulnerabilities individual communities across globe determine affected extreme events badly 1 5C matter future climate change affect world world warms worse impacts climate change become Limiting long term average temperature rises 1 5C seen particularly important landmark agreement signed Paris 2015 almost 200 countries pledged try curb global warming amount reference 1 5C generally understood mean 20 year average rather increase seen single year science completely certain according UN consequences 2C global warming versus 1 5C could include external extreme hot days could become average 4C warmer mid latitudes regions outside poles tropics versus 3C 1 5C sea level rise could around 0 1m higher 1 5C exposing 10 million people events including frequent flooding 99 coral reefs could lost compared 70 90 1 5C twice number plants vertebrates animals backbone could exposed unsuitable climate conditions across half geographical area several hundred million people may exposed climate related risks susceptible poverty 2050 1 5C call restrict temperature rise 1 5C partly designed avoid crossing called tipping points clear exactly sit thresholds passed changes could accelerate become irreversible collapse Greenland Ice Sheet Image source Getty Images Image caption Earth poles especially vulnerable rising temperatures 3 3 3 6 billion people highly vulnerable climate change according IPCC People living poorer countries expected suffer fewer resources adapt led questions fairness places typically responsible small percentage greenhouse gas emissions external However knock impacts could felt wide areas example crop failures linked extreme weather could raise global food prices governments climate change help keep global warming 1 5C limit agreed Paris 2015 CO2 emissions need net zero 2050 UN says means reducing greenhouse gas emissions much possible actively removing remaining emissions atmosphere countries considering net zero targets external However greenhouse gas levels still rising quickly world likely warm beyond 1 5C IPCC says However progress areas growth renewable energy electric vehicles World leaders meet every year discuss climate commitments recent COP29 summit November 2024 richer countries committed giving developing nations least 300bn Â£240bn year 2035 help tackle climate change However far less amount poorer countries say need Many countries also hoped deal struck 2023 transition away fossil fuels energy systems would strengthened happen Five takeaways dramatic COP29 individuals climate change Major changes need come governments businesses individuals also help actions like taking fewer flights using less energy improving home insulation energy efficiency switching electric vehicles living car free replacing gas central
