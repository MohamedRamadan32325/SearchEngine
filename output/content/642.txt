Study coauthors Mark Bellin Hannah Hirou prepare antivenom course research Nicholas Bayless first antibody known LNX D09 protected mice lethal dose whole venom six snake species addition varespladib granted protection additional three species Finally researchers added second antibody isolated Friede’s blood called SNX B03 extended protection across 19 species antivenom offered mice 100 protection venom 13 species partial protection 20 40 remaining six researchers noted study Steven Hall snakebite pharmacologist Lancaster University United Kingdom called “very clever creative way” develop antivenom Hall wasn’t involved research cocktail tested humans approved clinical use Hall said human origin antibodies would likely mean fewer side effects antivenoms made traditional way using horses animals often result allergic reactions “It’s impressive fact done one two antibodies plus small molecule drug increases number species versus regular antidote think good job highlighting potential utility combining small molecule drug antibody ” Hall added “If makes clinic makes people long run would revolutionary actually would completely change field terms snakebite treatment ” said Columbia’s Kwong said published research focused class snakes known elapids include viperids major group venomous snakes includes rattlesnakes saw scaled vipers additional species However team investigating whether additional antibodies identified Friede’s blood agents might offer protection viperid family snakes “The final contemplated product would single pan antivenom cocktail
