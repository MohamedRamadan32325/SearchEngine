Icebergs like would floating coast Scotland 18 000 years ago Icebergs large cities potentially tens kilometres wide roved coasts UK according scientists Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left drifting icebergs gouged deep tracks North Sea floor 18 000 years ago first hard evidence ice sheet formerly covering Britain Ireland produced large bergs findings could provide vital clues understanding climate change affecting Antarctica today scientists searched fingerprints giant icebergs using detailed 3D seismic data collected oil gas companies wind turbine projects ocean surveys bit like MRI scan sediment layers beneath present day seafloor going back millions years researchers found deep comb like grooves interpreted created keels large icebergs broke British Irish ice sheet 18 000 years ago scratch marks close 90 miles 145km Scotland present day east coast found evidence gigantic tabular icebergs basically means shape table incredibly wide flat tops said James Kirkham marine geophysicist British Antarctic Survey lead author new study published journal Nature Communications seen shows definitively UK ice shelves way produce gigantic tabular icebergs Ice shelves floating platforms ice glaciers extend ocean analysing size grooves scientists estimate icebergs could five tens kilometres wide 50 180m thick although difficult exact means would covered area roughly big medium sized UK cities like Norwich Cambridge icebergs comparable size smaller icebergs found present day Antarctica blocks calved Larsen B ice shelf 2002 Dr Kirkham described seeing iceberg working Antarctica two years ago us working paper standing together gazing onto iceberg thinking Wow probably similar size iceberg found shore Scotland 18 000 years ago right front us Antarctica today Clues Antarctica Hundreds ice shelves surround three quarters today Antarctic ice sheet helping hold back vast glaciers ice shelves lost glaciers behind speed depositing ice ocean raising sea levels worldwide Exactly plays though one largest sources uncertainty models sea level rise Dr Kirkham told BBC News partly scientists able use satellites decades observe 10 cases ice shelves collapsing hence desire look examples back time ice shelf setting researchers say findings former British Irish ice sheet could help understand Antarctica might respond today rapidly warming climate looking changing scratch marks seafloor researchers discovered abrupt shift Britain icebergs 18 000 years ago time planet gradually warming cold period occasional production giant bergs ceased Instead smaller ones produced much frequently indicates ice shelves suddenly disintegrated without massive floating platforms large icebergs could longer produced potentially important coincides time glaciers behind began retreat faster faster crucial unresolved question whether disintegration Britain former ice shelves merely symptom quickly melting ice sheet whether loss shelves directly triggered runaway retreat ice Resolving chicken egg dilemma Dr Kirkham put would shed light serious impacts losing today Antarctic ice shelves might ocean records fascinating implications Antarctica illustrate fundamental role ice shelves buttressing holding back flow continental ice ocean said Prof Eric Rignot glaciologist University California Irvine involved study argument collapse ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse part story main forcing warmer air temperature warmer ocean temperature argued Graphics Erwan Rivault Scientists probe secrets mega icebergs West Antarctic ice shelf melt
