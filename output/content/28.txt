diabetes depression Here’s check world technologically driven longevity clinics increasingly sophisticated imaging scans cost tens thousands dollars turns one best assessments muscle strength quality simply sit chair squeeze tennis ball recommendation offered Joshua Davidson strength conditioning researcher University Derby studies hand grip strength metric increasingly recognised one reliable markers human health testing grip strength clinical trials scientists typically use hand dynamometer device squeeze hard possible measure force generated muscles hand forearm Several companies attempting take dynamometer clinic home combining easy use devices mobile apps let anyone chart grip strength time However according Davidson still get decent idea simple squeeze test tennis stress ball need object grasp deformed without causing pain discomfort says Simply squeeze long grip fatigues able maintain maximal squeeze something like tennis ball 15 30 seconds would good standard strive Noting long squeeze help track grip strength time course Mark Peterson physical medicine rehabilitation professor University Michigan points weak grip strength alone relatively little impact everyday life directly beyond making little bit harder open cans jars researchers increasingly using grip strength proxy overall musculoskeletal strength throughout body reflect whether person active enough sedentary indicate risk frailty – condition vulnerable result decline one physiological health Getty Images possible improve grip strength physically active Credit Getty Images first came scientists attention particularly notable study nearly 140 000 adults across high middle low income countries found grip strength better predictor premature death obvious indicators blood pressure research revealed person grip strength indicate likelihood living past 100 one study volunteers grip strengths measured 1965 1968 56 68 years old survival tracked next 44 years became centenarians 2 5 times likely grip strength results highest third compared died age 79 Darryl Leong associate professor medicine McMaster University Canada explains handgrip strength – therefore overall muscular strength – sum nutrition physical activity whether illnesses reason associated many health outcomes says One study used dynamometer testing found grip strength scores less 25 5 kilograms men 18 kilograms women suggests heightened risk sarcopenia throughout body progressive loss muscle mass function linked decreased strength mobility later life greater likelihood falling developing fractures Guillaume Paré practising physician professor medicine McMaster University says possible tell lot even simple handshake grip strength serving marker whether someone likely sarcopenia Weaker handshakes fingers struggle close completely around hand hand muscles emaciated red flags says links grip strength longevity go well beyond physical capabilities Studies shown muscle key player metabolic system acting reservoir soak excess blood glucose help prevent development insulin resistance weaker grip indicate person prone plethora problems linked metabolic dysfunction ranging type 2 diabetes lower bone mineral density malnutrition cognitive impairment depression ©2011 Massy Westropp et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd Grip strength See compare Credit ©2011 Massy Westropp et al licensee BioMed Central Ltd dynamometer hand use chart compare grip strength results taken study average grip strength measurements healthy people sex across different age groups Back 2022 Peterson led study assessed grip strength 1 275 men women compared results analysis DNA team found lower grip strength scores showed signs accelerated ageing Specifically differences DNA methylation patterns – tags associated DNA alter way read lifetimes Methylation patterns often change response environmental lifestyle factors obesity pollution even social stress among many things Wrist curls Improve grip strength Begin sitting arms lap Grip hand palm facing upwards slowly bring upwards towards body without moving arm Hold second carefully lower back practise aim build five sets 20 repetitions Paré unsurprising says sees grip strength key marker disease resilience likelihood recovering chronic illnesses example research cancer patients shows poorer grip strength likely experience sudden weight loss cachexia – extreme muscle fat loss despite eating normally – thus worse prognosis survival outcomes means disease ability fight limited says Peterson example risk dying pneumonia much increased individuals lower grip strength makes sense considering importance good muscular health properly clear airways sputum saliva mucus coughed respiratory tract result infections Grip strength something aware later life either Researchers even found average grip strength population tends correlate many medals country likely win Olympic Games Meanwhile Paré says teenagers young adults poorer grip strength likely prone health issues earlier age One study Brazil showed teenagers spent time screens either phones devices tended worse grip strength data supporting association low grip strength poor metabolic health even young adults says Paré Improving score improve grip strength Certainly says Davidson something work irrespective age suggests simply using tennis ball test progressively work muscles hand forehand contract maximal power long practise see steady improvements time says like • Sit stand simple test reveals ageing • ruler drop test Check reaction times • fingernails reveal health also grip Leong recommends working physically active general training muscles lower upper body says grip strength improve accordingly older adults Leong suggests trying timed get go test individual records stopwatch time taken rise chair walk three metres turn around return seated position says Leong test lower limb strength mobility help improve total muscle strength Davidson says general resistance exercises improve muscle mass maintain bone mineral density lead improvements grip strength need engage regular physical activity age says work home either using specialist equipment things around house Two
