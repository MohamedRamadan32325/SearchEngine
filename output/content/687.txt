Maren Stubenvoll Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — Living house made fungi bacteria may sound like stuff science fiction researchers one step closer eventually making reality according new study research team Montana grew dense spongy tangles mycelium — rootlike structure connects fungal networks underground — framework create living self repairing building material ability create durable load bearing structures living material still many years away However discovery important step toward creating sustainable alternative cement binding agent concrete said Chelsea Heveran senior author study published April 16 journal Cell Reports Physical Science 4 billion metric tons 4 4 billion tons cement manufactured annually contributing 8 global carbon dioxide emissions according London based think tank Chatham House means cement production country would rank third China United States based 2023 emissions “We asked ‘what could different way using biology ’ That’s vision ” said Heveran assistant professor mechanical industrial engineering Montana State University Bozeman Petri dish containing bacterial culture examined inverted light microscope microbiology lab Rafe Swan Image Source Getty Images Related article Scientists warn ‘unprecedented’ risks research mirror life study authors introduced bacteria capable producing calcium carbonate — chemical compound found coral eggshells limestone — fungal mycelium served scaffolds process called biomineralization calcium carbonate hardened gooey flexible mycelium stiff bonelike structure “We’re first ones biomineralize something call building material … want keep bacteria alive longer there’s challenges involved extend viability ” Heveran said “So that’s gave fungal mycelium scaffolds mycelium really robust nature sometimes biomineralizes ” team experimented letting fungus called Neurospora crassa biomineralize found killing adding microbes helped achieve stiffer material less time bacteria called Sporosarcina pasteurii created crystalline nets calcium carbonate around fungal threads metabolizing urea like food bacteria biomineralized building materials considered “living” days Heveran said team able keep microbes active least four weeks eventually period could extend months even years “We’re really excited next work ask questions ‘could seal crack material ’ ‘could sense something using bacteria ’ Like imagine poor air quality building bricks walls Could light indicate ” Heveran said “Before couldn’t microbes weren’t alive enough they’re alive ” Senior author Chelsea Heveran center Montana State University Bozeman students left Ethan Viles Liv Aspholm work team prepare biomineralized material Maren Stubenvoll There’s still mush room improvement used homes fences construction lot testing needed find living building material replace cement said Avinash Manjula Basavanna bioengineer involved study “These kinds experiments done small scale … necessarily reflection bulk material properties ” said Manjula Basavanna senior research scientist Northeastern University Boston “It’s stiffness people interested comes construction materials strength load bearing ability ” strength durability living building materials par concrete yet Heveran said mycelium still promising base

body cells within living building materials need structures capable delivering nutrients stay alive However adding structures design building materials could make weaker presenting challenge future studies Manjula Basavanna said “I think future could useful single story buildings smaller structures — it’s much feasible ” Manjula Basavanna said “It might five 10 years line ” Fungus also potential respiratory hazard though killing mycelium reduces allergen producing ability research done it’s considered safe inhabit Heveran said “It’s clear conceptualize test framework materials need strong enough kinds standards exist already ” Heveran said “But don’t regulatory standards bricks cells ” Looking ahead It’s safe say won’t see fungus bricks sold local home improvement store time soon

said “But society might lot cheaper you’re trying build infrastructure community really needs you’re trying build infrastructure space might lot easier carting cement concrete ” explained “The
