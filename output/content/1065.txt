Sheffield Astronomers spotted around dozen weird rare blasts Could signs special kind black hole Astronomers never seen anything like – something vast depths space went boom Telescopes Earth picked astonishingly bright unusual explosion 2018 watching played 200 million light years away blast brightened rapidly brilliantly far one would expect regular star explosion supernova disappeared Given label AT2018cow weird looking blast – size solar system – soon become known memorable nickname Cow Since dazzling event astronomers detected handful similar explosions across cosmos Described luminous fast blue optical transients LFBots share characteristics luminous says Anna Ho astronomer Cornell University New York hence L LFBot blue colour result explosion extraordinarily high temperature around 40 000C 72 000F shifts light blue part spectrum last letters acronym refer fact events appear visible light spectrum optical short lived transient Initially scientists thought LFBots might failed supernovae stars tried explode instead imploded forming black hole core subsequently consumed inside However another theory gaining traction – cow flares triggered undiscovered class mid sized black holes known intermediate mass black holes swallow stars stray close research paper published November last year described fresh evidence idea suggesting might preferred explanation general sentiment shifting direction says Daniel Perley astronomer Liverpool John Moores University turns correct could provide vital proof existence elusive type black hole – missing link smallest largest black holes Universe vital clue one biggest mysteries dark matter Perley et al original cow explosion detected 2018 occurred around 200 million lights years Earth Credit Perley et al original cow flare 2018 detected robotic survey sky uses Earth based telescopes called Asteroid Terrestrial impact Last Alert System Atlas system caught explosion occurring galaxy 200 million light years Earth Noticeably 100 times brighter regular supernova came went days Normal supernovae take weeks even months run course explosion also strange flat structure according observations researchers University Sheffield UK Since astronomers identified dozen similar events also become known animal themed nicknames loosely based letters randomly assigned astronomical survey discovers ZTF18abvkwla also witnessed 2018 called Koala ZTF20acigmel spotted 2020 known Camel AT2022tsd found 2022 Tasmanian devil 2023 AT2023fhn called Finch Fawn Astronomers increasingly using telescope surveys study large portions sky effort seek events one flares send alert astronomers services Astronomer Telegram kind online message board astronomical events alerts aim prompt telescopes action pointing towards event hope observing detail blast fades view like • Earth threatening asteroids come • search Sun missing twin • Stupendously large big black holes get November Ho Perley discovered another new LFBot time designated AT2024wpp yet gain nickname thinking Wasp says Ho explosion particularly interesting brightest LFBot observed since Cow also discovered early brightening phase meaning astronomers could train lots telescopes – including Hubble space telescope – order learn best one since Cow says Perley Early observations hint Wasp caused failed supernova theorised scenario star would collapse process exploding Inside star shell black hole dense neutron star would form blast jets radiation shell creating called central engine would explain brief cow flare visible Earth Wasp seemed lack sign material flowing away explosion scientists would expect event says Perley However notes current findings preliminary still analysing data says looked like remnants star eaten intermediate mass black hole September 2024 Zheng Cao Netherlands Institute Space Research colleagues examined first detected LFBot also found evidence challenged failed supernova theory studying X ray observations event found appeared disk material surrounding explosion making computer model disk found looked like remnants star eaten intermediate mass black hole one 100 100 000 times mass Sun Larger black holes could mass millions even billions times greater Sun Find big black holes get article largest black holes Universe star eaten would occasionally cause black hole suddenly brighten larger chunks star consumed producing Cow flares spotted astronomers Earth believe study supports intermediate mass black holes nature AT2018cow similar LFBots says Cao Another idea LFBots actually class giant stars called Wolf Rayet stars torn apart much smaller black holes 10 100 times mass Sun Brian Metzger theoretical astrophysicist Columbia University New York among support idea says could form similar way pairs black holes – detected gravitational waves produce – except occasion one stars becomes black hole Nasa Hubble Space Telescope detected brief flash LFBot 2023 nicknamed Finch due designation AT2023fhn Credit Nasa intermediate mass black holes theory perhaps alluring favoured idea moment though correct would mean LFBots unique opportunity us study mysterious mid sized black holes astronomers reasonably confident intermediate mass black holes exist Universe one yet found definitive proof could extremely important acting missing link smallest black holes cosmos largest supermassive black holes one centre galaxy LFBots could reveal locations intermediate mass black holes common intermediate mass black hole model exciting says Perley still kind debated community whether intermediate mass black holes really exist evidence quire sparing find certain LFBots really need much larger sample Unfortunately really rare says Perley Data around 100 would ideal next step adds might get little closer number next year Israeli orbital telescope called Ultraviolet Transient Astronomy Satellite Ultrasat set launch expected find many LFBots among cosmic transients thanks large field view 204 square degrees equivalent seeing 1 000 full Moons space telescopes James Webb Space Telescope JWST could gather data singular LFBots long could trained direction explosion brightening JWST would perfect says Metzger However getting time telescope observations proved difficult proposed two times says Ho luck try year data arrives mystery strange explosions linger clear LFBots proved far unusual anyone
