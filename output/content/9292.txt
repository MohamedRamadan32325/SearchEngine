Scientists offer new clues Despite scientific name translates “terror crocodile ” Deinosuchus commonly called “greater alligator ” prior assessments evolutionary relationships grouped alligators ancient relatives However new analysis fossils along DNA living crocodilians alligators crocodiles suggests Deinosuchus belongs different part crocodilian family tree Unlike alligatoroids Deinosuchus retained salt glands ancestral crocodilians enabling tolerate salt water scientists reported Wednesday journal Communications Biology Modern crocodiles glands collect release excess sodium chloride Salt tolerance would helped Deinosuchus navigate Western Interior Seaway divided North America greenhouse phase marked global sea level rise Deinosuchus could spread across continent inhabit coastal marshes sides ancient inland sea along North America’s Atlantic coast new study’s revised family tree crocodilians offers fresh insights climate resilience group hints species adapted environmental cooling others went extinct salt glands allowing Deinosuchus travel alligatoroid cousins couldn’t terror crocodile settled habitats teeming large prey Deinosuchus evolved become enormous widespread predator dominated marshy ecosystems fed pretty much whatever wanted “No one safe wetlands Deinosuchus around ” said senior study author Dr Márton Rabi lecturer Institute Geosciences University Tübingen Germany “We talking absolutely monstrous animal ” Rabi told CNN “Definitely around 8 meters 26 feet total body length ” Research authors left Jules Walter Dr Márton Rabi University Tübingen Germany study skulls extant crocodilians including record size individuals institute zoology collection Márton Rab University Tübingen outlier among alligators Since mid 19th century fossils Deinosuchus found sides ancient seaway belong least two species largest Deinosuchus riograndensis lived western side along east coast island called Laramidia Bordered west Pacific Ocean Laramidia made less one third landmass North America continent’s island portion known Appalachia Deinosuchus long classified alligator relative distribution sides vast seaway unsolved puzzle alligatoroid — group today lives freshwater — could Deinosuchus cross sea spanning 620 miles 1 000 kilometers One hypothesis suggested early alligators saltwater tolerant later lost trait interpretation didn’t much evidence back hinged solely Deinosuchus included alligatoroid group Rabi explained Another possible explanation Deinosuchus dispersed across North America Western Interior Seaway formed divided western eastern populations However fossil record doesn’t back seaway appeared 100 million years ago making approximately 20 million years older earliest known Deinosuchus fossils “The picture wasn’t coherent ” Rabi said Hyaenodonta Courtesy Hesham Sallam Related article apex carnivore ‘king ancient Egyptian forest’ mysteriously went extinct fossil could offer clues new analysis researchers incorporated data extinct crocodilians sampled group’s earlier family trees “missing links” helped team connect species previously recognized related reassemble order certain traits emerged group “Our analysis found saltwater tolerance fairly ancient trait many crocodilians secondarily lost alligatoroids ” Rabi said even moderate tolerance salt would greatly benefited ancient crocodile relatives climate shifts reshaped habitats said Dr Evon Hekkala professor chair department biological sciences Fordham University New York City “This ecological trait would allowed lineages crocodiles past opportunistic times drastic environmental changes sea level rise causing extinctions less tolerant species ” said Hekkala involved study ‘greater alligator’ researchers also constructed new crocodilian family tree using molecular data modern crocodilians clarify features shared alligatoroids earliest alligators far smaller crocodilians lived time team found Alligators began evolve larger body sizes seen today 34 million years ago climate cooled competition went extinct alligatoroids first appeared Deinosuchus would outlier due massive bulk according new study Dwarfism early alligatoroids another clue giant Deinosuchus “greater alligator ” likely diverged different branch family tree alligatoroids evolved Rabi said Duonychus Hand reconstruction Masoto Hattori Related

picture Deinosuchus evolved Hekkala said Shifting Deinosuchus away alligatoroids “fits much better current understanding ecological flexibility among extinct living crocodiles ” added “This new paper really reaches evolutionary ecological role amazing animal ” Deinosuchus one largest crocodilians wasn’t giant Massive crocodilians evolved independently aquatic environments dozen times past 120 million years types global climatic phases — including ice ages according study Even living species reports individuals measuring 23 feet 7 meters persisted 19th century suggesting enormous
