intriguing mainly speaks human nature anything else – curiosities behaviour run deep cannot explain cultural explanations alone research evidence say matter enjoyable watching horror appeals watch something scary heart race feel physically edge Agitated maybe freeze still tensed Psychologists would say state extreme physiological arousal body’s stress response system Think things like surprised startled excited something body responding fight flight response bug need fight scary thing body pumps stress hormones like adrenaline order mobilise energy it’s ready put use immediately Watching horror media get system working energy bubbles away surface potentially making feel anxious agitated full nervous energy safe way enjoyable simply gets blood pumping feels exciting even thrilling Something like skydiving effect Ultimately you’ve intense emotional experience you’ve felt whole body exhilarating Another related explanation bit complex excitation transfer theory something build stress anticipation – negative feelings watching horror switch enjoyment euphoria tension released resolved end film it’s bit like rollercoaster – scary first exhilarating suspense course true types media contain element suspense without overt horror example TV dramas even video game play One way apply might watch horror film date evidence participating together frightening events lead partner find attractive – known misattribution arousal – excited state fear overlap contribute excitement romantic attraction first study looking used participants met researcher outside participants found attractive met middle precarious bridge external PDF similar classic experiment dealing emotion resulted Schacter Singer theory emotion test subjects unknowingly given adrenaline create state physiological arousal directed toward feeling different emotions based different lab settings became angry others became happy euphoric depending emotions others around may explanation bridge phenomenon perhaps frightened nervous energy diverted toward feelings romantic attraction met researcher Back horror films enjoys Personality may influence people engage horror media People high trait sensation seeking enjoy horror – seeking varied novel complex intense sensations experiences willingness take risks sake experiences you’re open new experiences actively seek may likely enjoy film especially case also high intellect enjoy things stimulating challenging – horror fits perfectly Research also suggests you’re highly empathetic may enjoy horror Men boys prefer watch horror women girls – suspect connection testosterone higher men disgust sensitivity higher women also different interests might encouraged boys vs girls growing psychopathy research suggests presence dark triad traits yes real scientific term – seems appropriate context related enjoyment horror media three traits narcissism psychopathy Machiavellianism Different types psychopathy related horror movie preference well things like violent sports aversion romance pop music non violent sports However don’t need psychopath enjoy horror cinema Recent research shows relationships small explanation liking horror films lies somewhere disordered personality – example sensation seeking described What’s perhaps interesting dark triad personality traits regularly utilised create frightening characters genre film probably explains people think must psychopath enjoy evolutionary element horror enjoyment evolutionary researchers weigh I’m quite amenable approach way got psychology initially studying human evolution shaped behaviour can’t leave one threat simulation theory idea simulation threat scenarios help us prepare real life events ultimately safe albeit masochistic emotional stimulation Humans evolved world much violent dangerous today simulation could serve genuine purpose preparing people bad things happen course odds things happening modern life low engaging could somehow pleasurable might conferred advantage ancestors likely types events depicted horror media little odds occurring today example hunted predators followed murderer much common evolutionary past Thinking might situation like could seemed commonplace ancient ancestors perhaps led survival – living opposed dying allowed genetic lineage continue passing innate feelings behaviours us today evidence supporting theory Research shows people tend engage horror media fits world view suggesting frightening depictions seem plausible enjoyable example believe paranormal tend prefer supernatural horror e g demons witches atheists tend prefer human based baddies thought people seek horror might find somehow likely occur real life course happens unconsciously – don’t think it’s likely anyone would consciously purposefully seek horror movies help prepare real life disaster ever befall threat simulation theory doesn’t explain many people aversive type media likely differences personalities likely explain great deal variation likes horror interesting recent finding horror fans appear psychologically resilient face Covid 19 less psychologically distressed feel prepared pandemic Importantly unclear whether causal relationship – horror consumption led directly Covid 19 resilience – whether underlying psychological traits lead horror consumption resilience high emotional stability Nonetheless supports threat simulation theory modern environment psychological preparation adverse events may provide buffer stress occurs real life Whether use advantage lives rather elusive Perhaps might strive push boundaries consuming horror media suspenseful crime dramas video games sort thing isn’t really street begin might become anything terrified Published February 2021 Share Page Email Facebook X
