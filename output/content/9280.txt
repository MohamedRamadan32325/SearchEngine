Dharmawardena NYU Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — invisible molecular cloud could shed light stars planets form detected surprisingly close Earth Named Eos Greek goddess dawn cloud gas would appear huge night sky visible naked eye measures roughly 40 moons width weight 3 400 times mass sun researchers reported study published Monday journal Nature Astronomy “In astronomy seeing previously unseen usually means peering deeper ever sensitive telescopes — detecting smaller planets … distant galaxies ” said study coauthor Thomas Haworth astrophysicist Queen Mary University London “This thing pretty much cosmic backyard we’ve missed ” added Molecular clouds composed gas dust hydrogen carbon monoxide molecules form Dense clumps within clouds collapse form young stars Scientists usually spot molecular cloud using radio infrared observations pick chemical signature carbon monoxide Haworth explained “We normally look carbon monoxide one carbon atom one oxygen atom emits light pretty easily wavelengths detect ” said “ Carbon monoxide bright lots facilities spot ” However Eos eluded discovery despite closest molecular cloud Earth contain much carbon monoxide therefore doesn’t emit characteristic signature detected conventional approaches researchers said key unlocking stunning find searching ultraviolet light emitted hydrogen cloud “The reason managed catch instance we’ve able look different color light ” Haworth added window solar system formation Haworth colleagues detected Eos data collected far ultraviolet spectrograph called FIMS SPEAR operated instrument Korean satellite called STSAT 1 data released publicly 2023 lead study author Blakesley Burkhart associate professor department physics astronomy Rutgers School Arts Sciences came across spectrograph breaks far ultraviolet light emitted material component wavelengths similar prism visible light creating spectrum scientists analyze “This first ever molecular cloud discovered looking far ultraviolet emission molecular hydrogen directly ” Burkhart said news release “The data showed glowing hydrogen molecules detected via fluorescence far ultraviolet cloud literally glowing dark ” whirling lines sky trails stars hour long exposure Kitt Peak National Observatory KPNO Program NSF NOIRLab trails

systems form Burkhart said “Our discovery Eos exciting directly measure molecular clouds forming dissociating galaxy begins transform interstellar gas dust stars planets ” Burkhart said Astronomers thought good handle locations properties molecular clouds within 1 600 light years sun making “pretty cool discovery” quite surprise said Melissa McClure assistant professor University Leiden Netherlands “This new molecular cloud Eos 300 light years away closer molecular clouds we’ve known previously ” McClure wasn’t involved research said “It’s puzzling there’s something big right solar neighborhood didn’t see ” McClure added “It would bit like living suburb ground houses open lots suddenly realizing one open lots actually hosts hidden underground bunker ” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad
