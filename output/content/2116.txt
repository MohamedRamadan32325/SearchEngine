cluster locations around world people region average look similar people areas – far obvious 18th Century traits primary determinants new fashion categorising humans supposedly scientific terms Swedish botanist Karl Linnaeus legitimately credited father modern biology gave us classification system still use today genus species Every living thing named according system example bacteria Escherichia coli lion Panthera leo Gorilla gorilla probably need explaining Homo sapiens – wise people foundational work Systemae Naturae Linnaeus introduced another tier classification us designated primarily visible human traits pigmentation Linnaeus gave us four types human lumped together continental landmasses Asiaticus – people yellow skin straight black hair Americanus – indigenous Americans red skin also straight black hair Africanus – black skinned people tight curls hair Europeaus – white skinned blue eyes Introducing classification system humans ludicrous racist importantly hierarchical would leave indelible mark centuries followed designations clearly absurd – none colours accurate even took obviously incorrect view millions people share skin tones even within categories roots race designations still use today visible labels terms fallen social acceptability considered racist still use black white descriptors millions people none really either black white skin Even colour scheme true Linnaeus original descriptions began physical traits included later editions Systemae Naturae became basis scientific racism portrayals behaviours Asiaticus described haughty greedy ruled opinions Americanus labelled stubborn zealous regulated customs Africanus women denoted without shame sexes said crafty lazy governed caprice described Europaeus gentle acute
