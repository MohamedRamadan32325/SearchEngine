advancements CNN — direct ancestor Tyrannosaurus rex would arrived North America crossing land bridge Asia according new study report latest weigh fierce debate among paleontologists origins king dinosaurs team led Cassius Morrison doctoral student paleontology University College London UCL used mathematical modeling conclude rex precursors likely arrived North America crossing Bering Strait modern day Siberia Alaska around 70 million years ago finding tracks past research suggests rex closely related large carnivore Tarbosaurus Asia compared top predators North America Daspletosaurus Morrison said statement time area would home temperate rainforests climate somewhat similar British Columbia today Morrison told CNN Tuesday rex ancestors — tyrannosaurids — would fewer number within environment compared herbivorous dinosaurs preyed much like apex predators lions today Morrison said Duonychus Hand reconstruction Masoto Hattori Related article Largest fully preserved dinosaur claw unearthed Mongolia’s Gobi Desert “And fewer also fewer chances preserved fossil record ” said Faced lack evidence Morrison coauthors instead used mathematical models incorporate data existing fossil record rex family tree well climatic environmental conditions Morrison said modeling also accounts gaps fossil record meaning updated new discoveries made future research added example Morrison said new study’s findings suggest fossils rex ancestors may still remain undiscovered Asia rex likely evolved giant team also found tyrannosaurids rex experienced rapid increase size period global temperatures falling suggesting dinosaurs better able thrive cooler climates perhaps thanks feathers fact warm blooded rapid growth size also came another group giant meat eating dinosaurs known carcharodontosaurids went extinct leaving “a vacuum top food chain ” according news release UCL Tuesday growth meant time dinosaurs went extinct rex could weighed much 9 metric tons “about large African elephant light tank ” according release Courtesy Denver Museum Nature Science Related article Hiking family discovers rare rex fossil Study coauthor Charlie Scherer master’s graduate Earth sciences soon doctoral student UCL said statement “findings shined light largest tyrannosaurs appeared North South America Cretaceous Period grew large end age dinosaurs ” “They likely grew gigantic sizes replace equally giant carcharodontosaurid theropods went extinct 90 million years ago ” Scherer said “This extinction likely removed ecological barrier prevented tyrannosaurs growing sizes ” Steve Brusatte paleontologist University Edinburgh Scotland involved study told CNN paper “is fine scholarly work forensically tracks tyrannosaurs meat eating dinosaurs time compares evolution changes climate “Even largest dominant dinosaurs affected weather seems like tyrannosaurs able get big multiple times independently cooler climates promoted increases size ” said “It easier big temperatures cool kings dinosaurs predestined rule helped along climate ” Brusatte added study published journal Royal Society Open Science Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback
