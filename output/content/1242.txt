climate meadowscaping become latest gardening craze Sara Weaner Cooper husband bought first home Pennsylvania knew want perfectly manicured front lawn like neighbours wanted something turf – flourishing wild meadow home diverse species plants animals bold plan sure considering involved overhauling entire lawn new neighbourhood Thankfully Weaner Cooper ideal support project – father Larry Weaner renowned ecological landscape designer executive director educational arm design firm landscape design style uses relies predominantly native plants says aiming work want grow rather forcing particular areas grew non traditional garden curated father remembers woodland wonderland designed support large trees Today still heavily wooded teems native plants prefer shadier plot property gets less light Coopers father plot plant much says intentionally engage encouraging seemed want likely spend seven times manage one hectare traditional lawn compared meadow – Shishir Paudel Weaner Cooper always wanted focus native plants lawn less mowing rewilding front lawn felt like right move Coopers lawn different animal father full Sun consisted 1 500 sq 16 000 sq ft turfgrass – narrow leaved grasses designed look uniform dealt meadow could fully take Rather rip everything live drab brown lawn months decided try strategically seeding planting native plants existing turf hoping would eventually weed turf naturally easier sense need beating back many weeds explains Weaner Cooper native plants came thickly outcompeted lot weed pressure would would made brown took two years lots planning careful weeding trial error eventually medley waist high native plant species blanketed vast front lawn Sara Weaner Cooper Coopers front yard teams different native flowers Credit Sara Weaner Cooper Meadowscaping turning traditional lawn meadow burgeoning trend experts field noticing especially among younger generations tend climate aware predecessors Compared lawns meadows – open landscapes filled array non woody plants tall grasses flowers herbs – less expensive maintain require less water energy help sequester CO2 importantly also encourage biodiversity typically appealing pollinators keystone species ecosystems depend Climate change habitat degradation leading major losses native species ecosystems worldwide turn disrupt ecosystems function Meanwhile lawns cover 23 US urban land areas 70 75 open green space cities worldwide people rewild lawns significant environmental impacts could seen lower pollution stormwater runoff reduction soil erosion urban heat island

fact Pennsylvania one handful states actively encouraging homeowners transition lawns meadows 2020 Pennsylvania Department Natural Resources started lawn conversion programme cases helps finance meadow projects cannot keep demand says Shishir Paudel plant ecologist Phipps Conservatory Pittsburgh Pennsylvania started eastern part Pennsylvania successful expanded western Pennsylvania last year Sara Weaner Cooper early stages meadowscaping lawn Weaner Cooper put sign garden reading native meadow progress Credit Sara Weaner Cooper Paudel colleague Sarah States director research science education Phipps Conservatory spent last six years studying differences environmental impacts traditional meadowed lawns hopes metrics collected help convince people convert lawns financial disparity thinks may turn heads well cheaper set conventional lawn seeded meadow far affordable maintain likely spend seven times manage one hectare traditional lawn compared meadow says Paudel Maintaining meadow also typically involves less work regularly mowing traditional lawn completely hands Every couple weeks peak season go trim things back mow paths meadow says Weaner Cooper looks intentional organised meadow Still meadowscaping look wild Coopers lawn Take Marc Johnson meadow Toronto Canada professor biology University Toronto Mississauga research urban landscapes impact plant pollinator interactions inspired create various pollinator gardens within front yard label accordingly Initially house pristine traditional lawn previous owner maintained using lots pesticides Johnson away pesticides took staged approach meadowscaping Unlike Coopers focused creating specific smaller pollinator gardens within yard also primed lawn somewhat differently clearing away much existing turf putting new soil planting large portion native perennials plants come back year year one garden time started convert space pollinator gardens different themes flavours says Johnson gradually took entire lawn Marc Johnson Johnson front lawn meadow broken smaller specific pollinator gardens including waystation monarch butterflies Credit Marc Johnson Pollinator populations worldwide declined precipitously last decades Monarch butterflies particularly impacted last 20 years US lost one fifth butterfly populations within first year lawn conversion Johnson says began see pollinators arriving flowering plants start see pollinators never seen yard even know area says One favourites bees butterflies would purple coneflower hardy easy grow perennial common gardens say one best species people start Starting meadow several ways meadowscape lawn works one property might another Still experts agree aim mostly native plant species 70 often cited ideal plants varying based location Johnson suggests finding reputable nursery asking easy grow likely come back also recommends starting small Even creating diverse little garden apartment balcony impact says looking quicker turnaround remove lawn natural lawn weed killer white vinegar pull start scratch says Weaner Cooper intensive brown lawn time give new native species room fresher soil grow various gardens lawn grew taller Johnson neighbours began asking questions mainly could properties says – none complained lack lawn two years whole yard transformed patchwork quilt gardens One section entirely dedicated evening primroses plant particular biological interest Johnson Johnson describes lawn version national park frequented hummingbirds endangered monarchs various species bees says even built bee hotel – although intended house honeybees says native species North America holes wood diverse ecologically important solitary bees native Johnson explains many different species nesting right coexisting although competing necessarily happy time lot diversity one location Johnson yard certainly involves upkeep especially tries maintain themes specific gardens also recognises need evolve Every year different species competing something gets really abundant sometimes pathogen come wipe things start come natural cycling species part makes meadows resilient Plant animal species may compete time time element healthy ecosystem encourages natural selection adaptation resilience meadows recent study King College University Cambridge UK measured effects rewilding half college 300 year old lawn saw similar ecological benefits meadowscaping found meadow side climate resilient traditional side lawn reflecting away 25 sunlight helps protect inhabitants heat damage Marc Johnson Johnson garden monarch butterfly sits purple coneflower also known echinacea – favourite perennial plant bees butterflies Credit Marc Johnson Plants typically found meadows also tend deep rooted thus drought tolerant makes ideal drier areas limits water consumption roots help prevent stormwater runoff even improve groundwater quality diverse systems deep roots water makes way bottom soil groundwater system says Paudel time filtered vegetation goes groundwater water becomes fresher less polluted Xeriscaping meadowscaping predominantly drought tolerant plants water saving practice American West 80 years Government agencies help landowners implement practice seen strong results 18 000 properties Southern Nevada example saw overall 30 reduction annual water use 54 reduction water costs converting turf landscapes xeriscapes Similar plants mitigate stormwater runoff Johnson planted ditch property prone flooding creating bioswale – shallow trench designed slow runoff plants help absorb water ground like • Meet Siku itchy polar bear allergies affecting animals • Resurrection plants drought resistant zombie plants come back dead • Elephants hate bees – good news Kenyan farmers put plants especially adapted wetlands also survive dry periods says plants help stormwater runoff rapidly sucking water storing leaves using evapotranspiration whereby plants release water atmosphere stomata leaves bring CO2 photosynthesis put water one end ditch time got right hand side water gone says Johnson Large scale bioswales even implemented cities like New York City reduce flooding sewer overflows stormwater pollute nearby bodies water heavy lifting lawn turnover initial planting meadowscaping easier winter months lawns dormant anyway – process called winter sowing Melanie Rekola horticulturist professional landscape designer Canada scraped away sod machinery put little bit soil got 100 native wildflower mix spread says spread fall couple frosts winter seeds get cold stratification exposure cold damp air helps germinate gets warm moisture need come springtime like always Coopers demonstrated however need remove everything lawn plant meadow Paudel suggests process called solarisation cover lawn clear plastic summer traps heat kills turf one week grass die plant deliberately says Still meadowscaping limitations one biggest invasive species overtake native plants meadow keep eye Keeping weeding take little bit time like know border garden says Johnson Marc Johnson bee hotel Johnson garden aims encourage local native bees Credit Marc Johnson Meadowed lawns shown notable health benefits may even reduce amount air sound pollution enters home Paudel says even roadside vegetation acts physical barrier filter Vegetation holds air particles live roadside tall plants less air pollution enter house Surrounding nature also linked reduced pain improved cognitive function restored attention executive functioning children adolescents mental health booster look window spring summer fall almost every day changing beautiful says Weaner Cooper takes fair amount intentional curating rewilded lawns seem feel something beyond pride rather reverent stewardship local ecosystem Imagine half urban population took view
