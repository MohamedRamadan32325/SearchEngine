Dr Neil Jennings Imperial College London day day basis switching lights appliances use help us save money reducing impact climate change UK government currently offers grants Â£7 500 installation heat pumps England Wales external Boiler Upgrade Scheme runs 2028 heat pumps work get one Improving insulation walls ceilings windows reduce loss heat homes means less energy needed heat temperature reducing greenhouse gas emissions saving money Draught proofing one cheapest effective forms insulation according Energy Saving Trust EST external involves blocking unwanted gaps let cold air warm air around windows doors 2 Cut food waste cut red meat Overall global food system contributes quarter third greenhouse gas emissions external figures include meat dairy industries also food sources like crops food sources equally bad environment Red meat beef lamb particularly high carbon footprint cutting consumption red meat help reduce climate impact even food source range impacts depending

Jennings However ditching car possible everyone particularly live area without good public transport disabled Small actions still impact like walking cycling local shops sharing car journeys friends neighbours Switching electric car also greatly reduce carbon footprint Unlike petrol diesel cars fully electric cars produce carbon dioxide driving along although emissions manufacturing vehicle generating electricity powers lifetime fully electric cars cut emissions around two thirds Europe United States external compared petrol equivalents electricity gets cleaner wind solar displacing fossil fuel power electric cars even bigger emissions advantage petrol diesel cost electric cars expensive historically prices generally coming result number electric cars growing quickly external parts world particularly China Europe Unfortunately keen travellers flying one carbon intensive things individuals Domestic flights largest emissions per person per kilometre Taking journeys train reduce climate impact fly lot reducing number flights take make considerable difference personal footprint says Dr Jennings 4 Think buy single pair types jeans produce 30kg carbon dioxide equivalent across lifespan taking account cotton production manufacture transport washing However carbon footprint different types clothing varies substantially case case much buy make difference Image source

last longer increasing number companies offering clothes rent helps reduce waste fashion industry could also try buying second hand Choosing right household appliances also positive effect carbon
