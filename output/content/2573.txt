help keep planet cool currently less ice ever previously recorded satellite data shows Sea ice around north south poles acts like giant mirror reflecting much Sun energy back space rising temperatures cause bright layer shrink dark ocean absorb heat warming planet latest sea ice low appears driven combination warm air warm seas winds breaking apart ice 5 days 13 February combined extent Arctic Antarctic sea ice 15 76 million sq km 6 08 million sq miles according BBC analysis data US National Snow Ice Data Center NSIDC breaks previous 5 day record low 15 93 million sq km 6 15 million sq miles January February 2023 Arctic sea ice currently smallest recorded extent time year Antarctic sea ice close new low satellite records going back late 1970s decline Arctic sea ice response warming planet well established end summer extent fell average 7 million sq km 1980s 4 5 million sq km 2010s mid 2010s Antarctic sea ice remarkably resilient defying predictions would shrink Since Antarctica shown series low sea ice extents although still lots natural variability Every year every data point get suggests temporary shift something permanent like seen Arctic Walter Meier senior research scientist NSIDC told BBC News indicating Antarctic moved new regime lower ice extents Antarctic sea ice relatively thin mobile surrounded ocean rather continents Arctic particularly sensitive winds breaking ice warmer air warmer waters look played key role latest 2025 low towards end southern hemisphere summer Antarctic ice shelves – ice flowing Antarctic continent rather sea ice – appear particularly extreme season surface melting driven high air temperatures Atmospheric conditions December January looked like strongly promoting surface melting ice shelves said Tom Bracegirdle research scientist British Antarctic Survey could also contributed seen Antarctic sea ice ongoing ocean warming setting backdrop well Antarctica record sea ice low 2023 would one 2 000 year event without climate change according recent study Yet 2025 far eclipsing end planet Arctic reaching annual maximum cold winter temperatures helping oceans freeze current sea ice extent nearly 0 2 million sq km anything previously recorded time year tracking low since late 2024 partly result late freeze ice around Hudson Bay unusually warm ocean waters taking long time cool well warmer seas storms also disrupted ice around Barents Bering Seas consequences likely amplified long term reductions sea ice thickness thinner ice cover responsive weather … weather events stronger impact used said Julienne Stroeve professor polar observation modelling University College London recent weeks Arctic sea ice moved even average Temperatures around north pole 20C normal early February leading melting conditions places like Svalbard quite astonishing time year according Dr Bracegirdle low winter extent necessarily mean Arctic end record conditions throughout 2025 conditions change quickly poles Arctic warming nearly four times faster global average declines coming decades almost inevitable Arctic expected essentially free sea ice end summer least 2050 according UN Intergovernmental Panel Climate Change recent studies suggest could happen sooner Declining sea ice poles implications local wildlife like polar bears penguins also Earth climate Polar sea ice already lost around 14 natural cooling effect since early mid 1980s area bright reflective ice declined according study published last year significantly change sea ice distribution around Antarctica modify part planet actually helping us fight climate change said Simon Josey professor National Oceanography Centre Sea ice also plays important role great ocean conveyor mass movement water helps distribute heat around planet keeps places like UK north west Europe relatively mild see another strong winter loss Antarctic sea ice people going start worry ocean circulation said Prof Josey Additional reporting Becky Dale poles
