dissolves easily acidic fluids like vinegar Credit Getty Images Reassuringly Eric Beckman chemical engineer emeritus professor University Pittsburgh Pennsylvania told best cleaning use acetic acid – main component vinegar – exactly using descaler Limescale – rust matter – consists certain ions dissolve easily acidic fluids like vinegar says Beckman uses vinegar get limescale mirrors microbiologist Dirk Bockmühl Germany Rhine Waal University Applied Sciences prefers using lemon juice contains citric acid says effective descaler smells better Read vinegar effective cleaner said vinegar work everything Beckman says soap better job removing oily films dishes baking soda effective processed oils stuck onto surfaces cooking Read whether baking soda environmentally friendly However Beckman expresses exasperation popular remedy mixing vinegar together baking soda mixture chemically quite useless says acid vinegar base baking soda effectively cancel use together says Beckman Together give nothing vinegar often touted powerful antimicrobial Bockmühl says truth nuanced 2020 study Bockmühl colleagues put vinegar test selection disease causing bacteria viruses fungi many internet recommendations suggest adding dash vinegar bucket water cleaning Bockmühl found anti microbial effects kick acetic acid concentration 5 – concentration pure vinegar fully effective distilled concentrations 10 – researchers added dash citric acid – killing five common bacteria including Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus well mould yeast weakened strain vaccinia virus studies found similar concentrations also work Sars CoV 2 virus causes Covid 19 even concentrations work MRSA bacterium especially stubborn strain Staphylococcus aureus resistant certain antibiotics countless bacteria remain untested Many bacteria – including ones ferment alcohol vinegar – thrive acids Beckman adds like ooh yay vinegar moulds resistant acetic acid viruses – like norovirus – might Bockmühl suspects Beckman says soaps effective bacteria standard disinfectants work better viruses moulds Harsh treatments like bleach definitely kill everything Beckman says – although bleach unsafe used

left one remaining question using vinegar environmentally friendly conventional cleaners hard question answer says Beckman Ideally would life cycle analyses cleaning products track impacts cradle grave tracing ingredient back source produced transported packaged eventually disposed companies thoroughly even brand products green Beckman says say vinegar strength simplicity Beckman says Conventional cleaners consist dozen different ingredients many industrially manufactured energy consuming processes says Acetic acid born natural yeast driven fermentation alcohol comes natural fermentation sugar biggest environmental impact vinegar making sugar came – whether grapes apples grains potatoes rice – largely renewable resources Bockmühl cautions applies naturally fermented vinegars ones typically sold food products also synthetic vinegars derived fossil fuels meaning come environmentally harmful impacts oil gas extraction Even end life vinegar little impact many
