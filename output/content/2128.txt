stickers Lack feedback therapists benefits exercises reported barrier using stickers every time addition interviewees talked results patients’ grip strength general consensus majority patients low grip strength levels consistent data collected regular reviews One therapist mentioned almost 85 patients high risk difficult manage patients within limited resources However nurses consultants reported patients’ grip strength surprising sometimes identified advantage grip strength test recognising patients described one consultant “middle ground” Consultants explained grip strength measurement added information patient’s health helped justify fully understand patient’s current future health status nurses took opportunity educate patients low grip strength importance healthy diet exercises nursing staff described sense satisfaction degree support extent grip strength measurement embedded normalised current practice reported grip strength became part routine nursing assessment stated every nurse think way questioning treated differently nursing assessments Evidence normalisation included stopping using label “grip strength study” referring new practice grip strength test admission paperwork across whole study wards However still significant variation extent normalisation across study wards reported consultants therapists summary description differences implementation practice across five wards presented Table 7 Table 7 Description differences implementation across five wards Full size table Discussion Implementation routine grip strength measurement among older people admission hospital proved feasible practical cheap fairly easy train large number staff measure grip strength relatively short period time busy clinical environment adoption implementation grip strength varied across wards Highly motivated champions managerial support shared commitment staff key factors successful implementation Inability build collective understanding commitment new measurement lack managerial support resulted inconsistent implementation wards high proportion older patients low grip strength would benefit early interventions focusing diet exercise Measuring grip

unlikely change within admission response hospital interventions useful stratify inpatient population Staff patients found grip strength measurement care plan easy complete beneficial identifying patients risk poor healthcare outcomes especially might missed routine assessments 37 Activating care plan interventions specifically physical exercises manage sarcopenia low muscle strength challenging mainly due lack therapists’ support reflected high workload limited number staff Training large number staff specific task well documented secondary care 38 39 primary care 40 41 However limited evidence literature training staff measure grip strength hospital setting one study service trained registered nurses measured grip strength 213 patients pneumonia admitted medical pulmonary unit urban teaching hospital 42 study report number staff received training trained Another study used two service Intensive Care Unit ICU physical therapists measure grip strength day awaking sample

ward champions showed remarkable characteristic champion rather seniority main determinant successful implementation champion role successful among delegated individuals highly motivated job appreciated benefits new test effectively communicated negotiated staff peers managers 44 champions believed well equipped fulfil role facilitate adoption new test Every ward encouraged initially determine best fit grip strength measurement daily routine Yet regular meetings allowed champions share stories experiences facilitating implementing best practice across study wards strong evidence effectiveness progressive resistance exercises increasing muscle strength among older people especially accompanied nutritional supplements 45 46 47 However delivering resistance exercises routinely older inpatients identified low grip strength challenging main reasons reported therapists organisational factors limited number staff work overload individual factors lack support senior therapists patient related factors dementia study reported 27 patients recalled encouraged hospital staff exercise 48 Study strengths limitations study several strengths first time shown feasible train large number nursing staff implement routine measurement grip strength among older people admitted hospital Using mixed method study design incorporated qualitative quantitative research methods validate data Data triangulation combining data collected different resources using different methods different times investigator triangulation use different observers minimise individual bias used enhance quality work Yet study also limitations study conducted one university hospital staff might positive attitudes towards research implementation evidence based research findings practice Therefore findings study may generalizable hospitals might less active research among different patient populations Additionally evaluate proportion trained staff performed grip strength measurement Future research Research nursing work acute care settings shown contextual factors example knowledge unit routine workflow influence nursing practice Therefore important replicate work departments hospitals compare variation clinical practices Furthermore study included old patients 80 years old majority identified low grip strength Implementing appropriate intervention mainly exercises found challenging age group would helpful target old inpatients earlier age 65 assess feasibility providing appropriate interventions mainly exercises Future research also focus evaluating cost effectiveness implementing grip strength practice Implications wider implementation Suggestions may facilitate implementation grip strength measurement routinely busy understaffed clinical practice include Liaising closely gaining support ward managers team leaders therapy manager dietetic leader Ensuring well briefed rationale long term outcomes measuring grip strength Nominating highly motivated active
