Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — Astronomers trying determine cosmic origins heaviest elements like gold decades new research based signal uncovered archival space mission data may point potential clue magnetars highly magnetized neutron stars Scientists believe lighter elements hydrogen helium even small amount lithium likely existed early big bang created universe 13 8 billion years ago exploding stars released heavier elements like iron became incorporated newborn stars planets distribution gold heavier iron throughout universe posed mystery astrophysicists “It’s pretty fundamental question terms origin complex matter universe ” said Anirudh Patel lead author study published Tuesday Astrophysical Journal Letters doctoral student physics Columbia University New York City statement “It’s fun puzzle hasn’t actually solved ” Previously cosmic production gold linked neutron star collisions narrow band image Sun wavelength λ 588 9nm well known solar sodium line also known “NaD line ” image acquired recent first light efforts VTF Inouye shows precisely structures within sunspot resolved imply thoroughly examined combining data image spectroscopy polarimetry available VTF pixel original version image corresponds 10 km 6 2 miles Sun VTF KIS NSF NSO AURA Related article First image world’s largest solar telescope captures sun unheard detail Astronomers observed collision two neutron stars 2017 cataclysmic clash released ripples space time known gravitational waves well light gamma ray burst collision event known kilonova also created heavy elements like gold platinum lead Kilonovas likened gold “factories” space believed neutron stars mergers occurred past several billion years said study coauthor Eric Burns assistant professor astrophysicist Louisiana State University Baton Rouge previously indecipherable 20 year old data NASA European Space Agency telescopes suggests flares magnetars formed much earlier — infancy universe — may provided another way creation gold Burns said Quakes stars Neutron stars remnants cores exploded stars dense 1 teaspoon star’s material would weigh 1 billion tons Earth Magnetars extremely bright type neutron star incredibly powerful magnetic field Astronomers still trying work exactly magnetars form theorize first magnetars likely appeared first stars within 200 million years beginning universe 13 6 billion years ago Burns said Occasionally magnetars unleash bonanza radiation due “starquakes ” Earth earthquakes occur Earth’s molten core causes motion planet’s crust enough stress builds results volatile movement ground quaking beneath feet Starquakes similar Burns said Artist Rendition Neutron Star Merger NASA Related article ‘Black widow’ heaviest neutron star devouring stellar companion “Neutron stars crust superfluid core ” Burns said email “The motion surface builds stress surface eventually cause starquake magnetars starquakes produce short bursts X rays like Earth periods given star particularly active producing hundreds thousands flares weeks similarly every particularly powerful quake occurs ” researchers found evidence suggesting magnetar unleashes material giant flare didn’t physical explanation ejection star’s mass Patel said It’s likely flares heat eject crust material high speeds according recent research several coauthors new study including Patel’s adviser Brian Metzger professor physics Columbia University senior research scientist Flatiron Institute New York City “They hypothesized physical conditions explosive mass ejection promising production heavy elements ” Patel said artist concept depicts magnetar releasing material space magnetic field lines shown green influence movement charged material around magnetar NASA JPL Caltech Tracing stellar signal research team curious see whether might connection radiation magnetar flares formation heavy elements scientists searched evidence wavelengths visible ultraviolet light Burns wondered whether flare might create traceable gamma ray well looked gamma ray data last observed giant magnetar flare appeared December 2004 captured retired INTEGRAL INTErnational Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory mission Astronomers found characterized signal know interpret time Burns said prediction model proposed Metzger’s previous research closely matched signal 2004 data gamma ray resembled team proposed creation distribution heavy elements would look like giant magnetar flare Data NASA’s retired RHESSI Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager Wind satellite also supported team’s findings Long term federally funded research enabled discovery Burns said “When initially building model making predictions back December 2024 none us knew signal already data none us could imagined theoretical models would fit data well quite exciting holiday season us ” Patel said “It cool think stuff phone laptop forged extreme explosion course galaxy’s history ” team scientists used NASAâs James Webb Space Telescope observe exceptionally bright gamma ray burst GRB 230307A associated kilonova Kilonovasâan explosion produced neutron star merging either black hole another neutron starâare extremely rare making difficult observe events highly sensitive infrared capabilities Webb helped scientists identify home address two neutron stars created kilonova image Webbâs NIRCam Near Infrared Camera highlights GRB 230307Aâs kilonova former host galaxy among local environment galaxies foreground stars neutron stars kicked home galaxy traveled distance 120 000 light years approximately diameter Milky Way galaxy finally merging several hundred million years later NASA ESA CSA STScI Andrew Levan Related article Explosion 1 million times brighter Milky Way creates rare elements Dr Eleonora Troja associate professor University Rome led discovery X rays emitted neutron star collision 2017 said evidence heavy element creation magnetar event “is way comparable evidence collected 2017 ” Troja involved new study “The production gold magnetar possible explanation gamma ray glow one among many others paper honestly discusses end ” Troja said Troja added magnetars “very messy objects ” Given producing gold tricky process requires specific conditions it’s possible magnetars could add much wrong ingredients excess electrons mix resulting light metals like zirconium silver rather gold uranium “Therefore wouldn’t go far say new source gold discovered ” Troja said “Rather what’s proposed alternative pathway production ” researchers believe magnetar giant flares could responsible 10 elements heavier iron Milky Way galaxy future mission could provide precise estimate Patel said NASA’s Compton Spectrometer Imager mission COSI expected launch 2027 could follow study’s findings wide field gamma ray telescope designed observe giant magnetar flares identify elements created within telescope could help astronomers search potential sources heavy elements across universe Patel said Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad
