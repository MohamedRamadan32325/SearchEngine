national grids next three decades aim enable large scale development transmission utilisation clean energy around globe according presentation 2019 Liu Zhenya chaired Global Energy Interconnection Development Cooperation Organization non governmental organisation set promote concept researchers UHV brings obvious benefits existing technologies UHV one send wind solar power far flung areas load centres places high electricity consumption says Fang Lurui assistant professor power system planning Xi Jiaotong Liverpool University Suzhou China Lauri Myllyvirta co founder Finland based Centre Research Energy Clean Air CREA agrees distances energy production sites cities challenge large country technology comes energy benefits China large – Sun set eastern China still shining western China says Myllyvirta low pressure zone generating high winds one part China another part China part completely different weather system time Therefore UHV transmission lines even variations solar wind generation zipping electricity place favourable weather conditions another says Challenges UHV However share wind solar power carried China UHV lines still low One reasons related high cost China investments UHV lines come two grid operators financial undertaking enormous official figure total investment released Huaxia Energy Chinese industry website reported August 2023 country spent 1 6 trillion yuan £173bn 222bn UHV lines included 33 already operation 38 construction Xiangjiaba Shanghai line example cost 23 billion yuan £2 5bn 3 2bn according official figures vast inputs mean grids must ensure lines annual operating hours order recover investments Therefore enough wind solar power line expected operate send coal power instead says Shen Xinyi researcher CREA wind solar power intermittent UHV lines still rely heavily coal gas fired power ensure transmission stable Shen notes 2022 56 2 electricity transmitted UHV lines China came renewable sources beating government target

China Sichuan two years ago summer exposed another weakness rigid management UHV lines China according Shen Even though Sichuan country hydro hub newly built hydropower stations world second largest hydropower plant Baihetan designed electricity exported eastern central regions via UHV lines Even enough electricity go around locally Sichuan – home several emerging manufacturing industries lithium batteries – could use hydropower UHV lines connected local grid Shen explains Yu Aiqun research analyst Global Energy Monitor US based NGO points may cost effective cities towns generate power locally import long distance expensive build UHV line Moreover Chinese coastal provinces planning build nuclear offshore wind power plants large scale means may need import electricity future Yu adds Researchers Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory US projected deployment offshore wind power would reduce Chinese coastal regions reliance imported electricity shift country transmission networks

regulatory issues says need lot paperwork permits etc make happen everyone wants transmission line next house Cost another roadblock especially US stakeholders involved long distance transmission line must greenlight project relevant regional transmission organisations also agree share cost according Wang Xuan advisor clean energy strategies Regulatory Assistance Project global non governmental organisation UHV taken US says Mega grids also mean higher risks mass blackouts one part fails like widespread power outage struck parts Canada US 2003 largely caused failure alarm system Ohio based electric utility affected whole network bigger get safeguards need prevent something like happening Arciniegas says Ultimately solution renewable future rely one transmission technology mix solutions many researchers believe One alternative end spectrum microgrids see localised energy generation storage usage gaining popularity developing countries nimble cost effective think distributed level developments individuals putting place solar panels community owned wind etc part solution says Antony Froggatt London based consultant climate change energy local generation security supply also education says high voltage lines different part world misses opportunity engaging people Arciniegas however UHV transmission part portfolio options countries need consider key one grid provides like
