world betting heavily carbon capture — term refers various techniques stop carbon pollution released industrial processes removing existing carbon atmosphere lock permanently practice free controversy arguing carbon capture expensive unproven serve distraction actually reducing carbon emissions fast growing reality least 628 carbon capture storage projects pipeline around world 60 year year increase according latest report Global CCS Carbon Capture Storage Institute market size 3 5 billion 2024 projected grow 14 5 billion 2032 according Fortune Business Insights Perhaps ambitious — expensive — type carbon capture involves removing carbon dioxide CO2 directly air although facilities currently operation worldwide scientists believe better option would capture carbon seawater rather air ocean planet’s largest carbon sink absorbing 25 carbon dioxide emissions UK government 2023 announced £20 billion 26 7 billion funding support carbon capture one project taken shape near English Channel Called SeaCURE aims find sea carbon capture actually works competitive air counterpart “The reason sea water holds much carbon put CO2 water 99 becomes forms dissolved carbon don’t exchange atmosphere ” says Paul Halloran professor Ocean Climate Science University Exeter leads SeaCURE team “But also means it’s straightforward take carbon water ” Pilot plant SeaCURE started building pilot plant year ago Weymouth Sea Life Centre southern coast England Operational past months designed process 3 000 liters seawater per minute remove estimated 100 tons CO2 per year “We wanted test technology real environment real sea water identify problems hit ” says Halloran adding working large public aquarium helps already infrastructure extract seawater discharge back ocean carbon naturally dissolved seawater easily converted CO2 slightly increasing acidity water make come water trickled large surface area air blowing “In process constrict 90 carbon water ” Halloran says SeaCURE pilot plant Paul Halloran SeaCURE Team CO2 extracted water run purification process uses activated carbon form charred coconut husks ready stored scaled system would fed geological CO2 storage water released acidity restored normal levels making ready absorb carbon dioxide air “This discharged water low carbon concentrations needs refill it’s trying suck CO2 anywhere sucks atmosphere ” says Halloran “A simple analogy we’re squeezing sponge putting back ” tests needed understand full potential technology Halloran admits doesn’t “blow direct air capture water terms energy costs ” challenges remove impurities water releasing well potential impact ecosystems adds carbon capture technologies incur high costs building plants infrastructure using seawater one clear advantage much higher concentration carbon air “so able really reduce capital costs involved building plants ” Mitigating impacts One major concern system captures carbon seawater impact discharged water marine ecosystems Guy Hooper PhD researcher University Exeter who’s working issue SeaCURE site says low carbon seawater released small quantities unlikely effect marine environment dilutes extremely quickly However doesn’t mean SeaCURE automatically safe “To understand scaled version SeaCURE might affect marine environment conducting experiments measure marine organisms respond low carbon seawater ” adds “Initial results suggest marine organisms plankton mussels may affected exposed low carbon seawater ” mitigate potential impacts seawater “pre diluted” releasing marine environment Hooper warns SeaCURE system deployed near sensitive marine habitats rising interest carbon capture seawater — also known Direct Ocean Capture DOC — several startups operating field Among Captura spin California Institute Technology working pilot project Hawaii Amsterdam based Brineworks says method cost effective air carbon capture CNN video Related video Turning Scotch whisky roads According Stuart Haszeldine professor Carbon Capture Storage University Edinburgh who’s involved SeaCURE although initiative appears energy efficient current air capture pilot tests full scale system require supply renewable energy permanent storage CO2 compressing become liquid injecting porous rocks deep underground says next challenge SeaCURE scale “to operate longer prove capture millions tons CO2 year ” believes huge potential recapturing carbon ocean water “Total carbon seawater 50 times atmosphere carbon resident seawater tens thousands years causing acidification damages plankton coral reef ecosystems Removing carbon ocean giant task essential consequences climate change controlled ” says Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback
