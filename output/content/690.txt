Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — almost overlooked fossil discovered Brazilian museum collection revealed oldest ant specimen known science according new research prehistoric ant lived among dinosaurs 113 million years ago — several millions years previously found fossilized ants — unusual way kill prey Anderson Lepeco researcher Museum Zoology University São Paulo said came across “extraordinary” specimen September 2024 examining fossil collection housed Museum Zoology University São Paulo museum one world’s largest collections fossilized insects contains specimens northeastern Brazil’s Crato Formation geological deposit renowned exceptional fossil preservation Preserved limestone newly described extinct insect what’s known hell ant member subfamily called Haidomyrmecinae lived Cretaceous period 66 million ﻿ 145 million years ago related ant alive today according study published Thursday journal Current Biology fossil species named Vulcanidris cratensis scythe like jaws likely used pin impale prey “I shocked see weird projection front insect’s head ” Lepeco study’s lead author said “Other hell ants described odd mandibles always amber specimens ” It’s rare find insects preserved rock hell ants Cretaceous found entombed amber France Myanmar date back around 99 million years ago hell ant lived what’s Brazil means ants already widely distributed across planet early point evolution study authors noted discovery sheds light ants evolved early Cretaceous time significant change also offers insight unusual features ant species period didn’t survive mass extinction ended dinosaur era researchers said CT scan used visualize ant would looked like Odair Meira Anatomical features lost time Today ants one conspicuous abundant groups insects planet found continents except Antarctica study noted However ants haven’t always dominant evolved late Jurassic early Cretaceous roughly 145 million years ago ant ancestors diverged group would give rise wasps bees wasn’t asteroid strike doomed dinosaurs species extinction 66 million years ago ants became common insect found fossil record according study fossil “pretty big deal ” said Phil Barden associate professor New Jersey Institute Technology studies evolutionary history insects “This new find represents oldest ant known extends known fossil record ants ten million years ” Barden wasn’t involved study said via email “Although fossil ants described since 19th century…Until clear absence ants older 100 million years around preserved deposits people looking ” added Reconstruction late Maastrichtian 66 million years ago palaeoenvironment North America floodplain roamed dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex Edmontosaurus
