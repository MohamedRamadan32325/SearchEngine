Editor’s Note new episode “The Whole Story “Saving Venice ” city threatened rising sea levels millions tourists desperate visit still airs Sunday May 11 8pm ET PT CNN Venice Italy CNN — It’s “floating city” also sinking city past century Venice subsided around 25 centimeters nearly 10 inches Meanwhile average sea level Venice risen nearly foot since 1900 It’s tortuous pairing means one thing regular flooding inexorable slump beloved cities watery depths famous lagoon visitors precarious status part attraction Venice — need visit it’s late symbol humanity cannot win power nature Venetians city’s island location centuries provided safety invasion also challenges Tides got ever higher frequent climate crisis intensifies city sinks around two millimeters year due regular subsidence could just… raise city sounds like science fiction fact it’s idea highly respected engineer thinks could key saving Venice Italian government currently spending millions euros year raising flood barriers block exceptionally high tides entering lagoon Pietro Teatini associate professor hydrology hydraulic engineering nearby University Padua says pumping water earth deep city would raise seabed sits pushing Venice skyward Would rise city waves could go terribly wrong causing buildings collapse Hollywood style scenes Teatini says plan would give Venice grace period around 50 years working tandem current flood barriers enabling authorities come permanent “drastic” solution believes system could raise city 30 centimeters nearly 12 inches clock ticking Battling waves MOSE flood barriers

Serenissima — “the serene” state known — constantly rerouting rivers digging new canals rechanneling waters lagoon serve city best 20th century however things started go wrong 1960s 1970s groundwater pumped industrial area Marghera mainland facing lagoon Big mistake — caused entire area sink 1950 1970 Venice’s precious city center subsided nearly five inches Today city’s main protection high tides MOSE set flood barriers rises seabed cut lagoon Adriatic exceptionally high tides system first trialed 2020 planned 1980s anticipated barriers would raised around five times year climate change contributing rising tides it’s different picture past 20 years tides lagoon exceeded 110 centimeters — essentially level cause disastrous rather “regular” flooding city — 150 times Rather barriers raised five times year MOSE already operated around 100 times since debuted October 2020 Yet barriers still test phase officially operational far project estimated cost around six billion euros Julia Buckley CNN Related article flood barriers might save Venice Meanwhile time barriers raised lagoon effectively closed — affects traffic coming Venice Italy’s second busiest port fifth Mediterranean prevents lagoon’s natural action flushing tides barriers raised ecosystem risks changing still Venice continues sink rate around two millimeters year tide levels rise around five millimeters per year Enter Teatini project give Venice couple decades breathing space raising level city 30 centimeters 12 inches believes could gift Venice two three decades — time city could work permanent way fight

stored summer create reserves Italy winter Engineers noted seasonal fluctuation land levels summer reserves filled gas land would rise winter reserves used land drops “Venice subsided 1950s 1970s groundwater produced industrial area Marghera mainland ” says Teatini “So based gas reserves observations idea try develop wells instead removing water inject ” project proposes drilling dozen wells 10 kilometer diameter six mile circle around city Venice making sure keep lagoon — extending Adriatic going mainland thick layer clay beneath surface lagoon means there’d chance water permeating upwards levels Teatini would target water aquifers saline famously there’s lack saline water Venice whose lagoon opens onto Adriatic Sea That’s crucial Teatini says project wouldn’t contaminate freshwater reserves require bringing water far afield Drilling test Teatini idea drill deep wells 10 kilometer ring around city Federico Meneghetti REDA Universal Images Group Getty Images idea “drill

rigs routinely stabilized water flows gradually aquifers land around rises — wells placed wide circle around Venice would raise land central lagoon says Teatini Crucially would stable uniform way — whereas raising city island island would unstable says raising effect would felt within circle wells extend outside covering smaller islands lagoon part mainland One major exclusion would Chioggia —

stays level sounds like recipe disaster — disaster movie Teatini insists safe way He’s pains point isn’t fracking — process liquids injected earth high pressure crack surface rock layers order access oil gas reserves Injecting fluids high pressure cause tremors Earth “We maximum 20 30 centimeter elevation gain don’t want crack ” says “If start cracking it’s disaster want maintain low pressure low level we’d want bring additive maintain expanded formation cracked ” issues could arise water pumped shallow aquifers says injecting water lower levels 600 1 000 meter depth enters deep earth three dimensional system “Even though expansion depth uniform moves land surface becomes smooth ” says works Teatini warns would temporary fix Comune di Venezia Related article Venice watching tourists’ every move 30 centimeters maximum engineers estimate land could raised without destabilization fact say avoid overloading aquifers would reduce pumping rate five times 10 years stop pumping water entirely land would contract — studying whether reach target volume could mix additives water keep land expanded ground ensure projections correct Teatini says they’d want test idea another part lagoon fewer wells two three years test would cost around 30 40 million euros roughly 32 43 million Even implementing full project would three times less expensive MOSE’s final tally says Injecting

would needed keep rising ground level shallow depths Modern strategies mooted include Teatrini calls “drastic” measure closing lagoon turning lake would preserve city destroy living breathing lagoon ecosystem housed Venice best part 2 000 years Teatini calls lagoon “part Venice ” Conversely experts raised concerns idea says usually geotechnicians work shallow soil “If speak people geomechanics deep earth it’s clear problem ” says David Dobson professor earth materials University College London said felt “skeptical optimism” told idea CNN “I think could experiment several years demonstrated control pump rate correct showed measurable dilation land surface might possibly sensible try ” Dobson warned kind activity far simple aquifer already lost fluid happened Marghera 20th century rocks sag creating what’s called “compaction bands” irreversible “It’s like blowing balloon — you’ve made balloon physically smaller ” said adding water fast much pressure create fractures rocks expand data Po Valley oil wells could suggest rock “reasonably isotropic” — layman’s terms uniform directions — says injecting water gas different Gas disperses quickly aquifer water takes longer flow — “so need
