activity world journalism releases carbon dioxide Reporters often need travel reach story whether across city afield need switch lights power laptops make phone calls industries journalism’s carbon impact lessen time world’s power grids transit systems powered sustainable energy reality face Future Planet new section devoted covering climate crisis pollution environment felt important much possible part solution result wanted minimise carbon footprint first keeping journalists’ travel minimum prioritising local voices doesn’t eliminate carbon emissions transport entirely Sometimes local regional travel essential lower carbon way tell story may come surprise digital publishing releases carbon emissions whole internet would sixth greatest emitter greenhouse gases country might also like Future Planet we’re tackling gender imbalance climate change photography needs new look Future Planet want accountable impact – transparent readers That’s Future Planet story carries figure estimating carbon emissions associated creating knowledge first major environment publication take step Getty Images large scale shift fossil fuels renewable energy real way reduce carbon emissions work Credit Getty Images get figures start breaking story’s carbon footprint two parts carbon emissions reporters’ transport story emissions digital infrastructure needed publish Transport emissions deciding whether even assign story much travel required key factor us reporter needs take flight reach story highly unlikely commission far Future Planet remained flight free publication would encourage look stories closer home discuss whether it’s possible story justice reporting phone video calls Cutting flights major way we’ve reduced carbon footprint Future Planet – single flight London say Cape Town example emits 1 6 tonnes carbon – equivalent running average home’s electricity nearly 100 days focus working local reporters around world also keeps long distance travel minimum longer distance story commissioned might ask reporter look around strong stories area make transport emissions story commissioned reporters keep note travel report story including far go method transport use

factors might argue counted story’s carbon emissions BBC staff work Future Planet full time many sporadically among obligations – count example energy used heat power office count carbon emissions large number energy hungry servers housed building irrelevant don’t host Future Planet could take even journalist ate sandwich location reporting us count carbon footprint food – since they’d likely eat regardless whether assignment energy used power laptop research wrote Looking ahead It’s easy get lost weeds remarkably quickly don’t see complexities excuse make accurate estimate based recent relevant research – open figures limitations currently use best tools available monitor emissions transport digital publishing new ways estimate carbon emissions complex connected digital analogue worlds improve refine carbon counting strategy match You’ll able read updates calculations involved complex assumptions made many varied heart Future Planet simple ethos want open carbon footprint
