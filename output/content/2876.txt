animated image start checking best fit job text images sound video interactive media useful animated image best option ensuring message clear digestible Take audience subject matter editorial principles account Back top Animated images vs embedded video opting use animation choose GIFs embedded video Imagine writing article physics pendulum swing concept movement timing difficult explain using text static images worth considering animation GIF full video player experience best BBC Standard Media Player SMP supports wide variety file formats puts user charge controls including stop rewind replay well designed video content may overkill animation short include sound require sophisticated playback controls Instead five second animation might needed best capture communicate entire idea concept opt animated images bear mind GIFs difficult compress files often large require relatively high levels energy render quickly deplete mobile phone battery support sound controlled natively user stopping rewinding Back top Animated images across BBC lots examples animated images put good use around BBC convey information improve presentation quick overview Animation great explaining complex movement sports BBC Sport illustrate movement cricket player Weather systems change time also effectively illustrated using animation BBC Weather illustrates growing storm hurricane tracking map course five days Texas Animation also add sense excitement fun otherwise static images CBBC uses animated version image page header children game show gazumping ground Back top Making animated images accessible Animated images really enhance user experience understanding limitations designed accessible way GIFs distracting could even cause seizures make sure animated images safe accessible need know Alt text like regular images animated images must use equivalent text convey information non sighted visually impaired users especially important image editorially significant Blinking flashing Animated images often blink flash presents number accessibility challenges Flashing content cause seizures many people unaware disorder strikes limit chance triggering seizures animated images flash three times per second flashing area small low contrast limits could flexible remember even image appear flashing guarantee safe use example clip news story showing celebrity walking red carpet might include photographers firing camera flashes rapid succession BBC mobile guidelines explain blinking flashing Web browser limits flashing viewing GIF particular web browser rate flashing may appear safely three times per second rule remember change browser browser publishing animated image important interrogate file Make sure look setting values find possible frame rate could given browser simple warning suffice safe may consider avoiding flashing together animated image flashing unavoidable reasonably minimise would warning suffice ever heard television announcer say something like warning next segment contains flashing images might think similar technique could applied web content warnings easily missed especially children may unable read better approach would modify image either slowing frame rate toning severity flash within safe limits Never ending loops constantly looping animated image distracting everyone people reading attention disabilities never ending GIFs make difficult even impossible successfully read surrounding text mitigate way user pause stop hide moving blinking scrolling information Starts automatically Lasts five seconds presented parallel content Measuring loops make sure GIFs distracting check total duration animation lasts longer five seconds modify image limit number loops calculating duration looping animated image use parameters defined WCAG guidelines Duration animation number frames x frame rate x number repetitions example simple blinking image two frames frame rate 0 5 seconds three repetitions duration 2 x 0 5 x 3 three seconds Using command line tool find number loops GIF Developers find section particularly useful… Trying measure parameters complicated especially considering delay frames may consistent Using tool measure parameters make job much easier GraphicsMagick gm released MIT License good option measuring loops example tool could used find number loops animated GIF following command gm identify verbose example gif grep Iterations Iterations 0 Notice number iterations example image set zero equivalent unlimited looping much longer five second goal correct adjust number looping cycles goal make total duration five seconds less formula Loops Math floor 5 LoopDuration case loop duration 2 2 seconds end two loops Modifying looping duration GIF lots tools used modify looping duration animated GIF using GraphicsMagick tool gm convert loop 2 example gif example twice gif resulting image named example twice gif loop twice loop duration 2 2 seconds expect total animation end four half seconds safely within five second limit Controlling animated images animated GIF file format GIF89a result relatively large files downloaded cause noticeable performance problems GIFs natively support play pause functions animation near bottom web page five second looping duration likely finished user ever scrolls far enough see issues addressed via technique called lazy loading displays relatively
