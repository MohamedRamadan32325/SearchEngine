reserves natural hydrogen Frank Zwaan GFZ CNN — Large reserves white hydrogen may exist within mountain ranges according new study raising hopes clean burning gas extracted supercharge efforts tackle climate crisis White hydrogen recently gained attention potential help replace planet heating fossil fuels couple decades ago scientists started saying powerful fuel — also called “natural” “geologic” hydrogen — existed within Earth’s crust large amounts Since geologists pored forms might located main problem working find volumes large enough useful humanity’s insatiable energy appetite find answers team scientists used computer models simulate movement planet’s tectonic plates pinpoint regions right conditions exist generating white hydrogen found mountain ranges Pyrenees European Alps potential hotspots according study published Wednesday journal Science Advances Hydrogen produces water burned long eyed green fuel especially energy hungry industries like aviation steel making commercial hydrogen produced using fossil fuels defeating climate saving powers That’s white hydrogen tantalizing prospect Drilling operations white hydrogen Natural Hydrogen Energy US Midwest Viacheslav Zgonnik Related article went hunting fossil fuels found could help save world Interest arguably traced back accidental discovery white hydrogen Mali 1987 water well exploded worker leaned edge cigarette well swiftly covered unplugged 2011 since producing hydrogen help power local village White hydrogen found US Australia France among places issue finding large amounts “We known nature produces hydrogen never really explored option energy production ” said Frank Zwaan study author geologist Helmholtz Centre Geosciences Germany energy sources easier access said escalating climate crisis amping race find alternatives gas forms naturally many processes including radioactive decay crust Zwaan’s team focused “serpentization ” water interacts iron rich rocks Earth’s mantle produce hydrogen rocks normally deep within Earth water isn’t readily available geological processes millions years push toward surface happens oceans continents break apart allowing mantle rocks rise also continents collide closing ocean basins forcing mantle rocks upward illustration white hydrogen accumulate mountain ranges Frank Zwaan GFZ scientists use tectonic plate modeling determine mantle rock “exhumed” quantities Zwaan said found certain mountain ranges including Pyrenees European Alps parts Himalayas offered good conditions generating white hydrogen large volumes mantle rock present favorable temperatures deep faults allowed water circulate quantities mantle rock available serpentize mountain ranges alone suggest white hydrogen “could game changer ” Zwaan said Geoffrey Ellis geochemist US Geological Survey involved research said processes bring mantle rocks close surface already well known What’s novel study told CNN “provides quantitative approach” assessing white hydrogen potential different settings mantle rocks lifted big question finding white hydrogen accumulates large reservoirs drilled Zwaan said may also possible artificially stimulate serpentization drilling areas mantle rocks close surface pumping water added Ian Berry CNN Related article Green hydrogen could fuel future Here’s it’s yet silver bullet Early exploration already happening areas including France Balkans US new research help guide geologists regions greatest potential large scale white hydrogen resources likely “a direct substantial impact geologic hydrogen exploration ” said Ellis many steps creating viable white hydrogen industry including developing reliable economic methods extract infrastructure store transport likely take decades commercialize Zwaan said “We expect instant miracle cure ” optimistic “Oil somewhat curiosity technique ready applied large scale ” said white hydrogen “may follow similar pathway ” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad
