vehicle station staff drive car onto platform integrated system removes depleted battery beneath car loads fresh one whole process takes five minutes Behind customers wait line overcast sky iconic Bird Nest Olympic stadium far distance Outside battery swap station slogan reads Battery swap stations equivalent gas stations electric vehicles Battery swapping – simply means changing depleted electric vehicle EV batteries fresh recharged ones – alternative charging batteries inside vehicle used vast majority world electric cars China able widely promote battery swap stations quickly since home main lithium ion battery manufacturers – Yihao Xie battery swap still largely nascent sector China world developed model far mainly used larger vehicles – close half electric heavy duty trucks sold China 2023 equipped battery swap technology – country also seriously experimenting swaps personal cars Chinese electric vehicle company Nio built 3 300 battery swap stations China Catl China world largest EV battery producer recently announced plans oil giant Sinopec build battery swapping ecosystem across whole nation Battery swapping big advantages particular lower amount time takes compared recharging battery inside car Still faces obstacles China also developing fast charging infrastructure breakneck speed fact experts say may countries unlike China remain early stage switch EVs battery swaps prove useful supporting electric car uptake – especially comes addressing range anxiety among drivers Iris Liu taxi battery swap station Beijing fully charged battery comes automatically compartment car Credit Iris Liu Especially early days electric vehicles difficult promote large scale due range anxiety says Daizong Liu East Asia director Institute Transportation Development Policy ITDP New York lack charging facilities led longer waiting times interruptions trips EV users Battery swap technology soon entered field potential solution Although first tested used century ago electric cars fell favour recent decades battery swaps electric cars initially picked EV battery swap company Better Place established Israel 2007 Operating Denmark Israel aimed reduce cost batteries well reduce range anxiety charging times received almost 1bn £760m funding company eventually went bankrupt 2013 citing difficulties consumer adoption securing sufficient support automakers Times Israel reported time weeks Better Place declared bankruptcy Tesla plans launch 90 second battery swap service widely reported initial swapping locations along routes Los Angeles San Francisco Boston Washington two years later began phasing swapping citing low market acceptance battery swaps would appear solve range anxiety currently always case China State Grid – largest utility company world – began researching battery swaps electric vehicles around 2006 seen way around large scale transformation power grid reliance pre charged batteries meant charging could done flexible times places comprehensive consideration China decided route battery swaps says Liu time China electric vehicles roads even decade later 500 000 2023 16 million pure electric six million hybrid cars one every three new car registrations year electric hybrid also 8 6 million charging points third added 2023 alone Plug battery cars dominated EV growth China 2021 also built least 900 battery swap stations year officially launched pilot battery swap scheme 11 cities projects scaling quickly 2023 China added around 1 600 new battery swap stations bringing total 3 570 stations according Chinese government data However EVs capable battery swapping – stations must compatible car battery system certain models designed make switch present battery swaps widely used commercial vehicles taxis logistics vehicles passenger cars Several Chinese experts told BBC several ways battery swap model proven less advantageous simply charging two horse race China charging technology constantly developing Mainstream electric vehicles China support high voltage fast charging 800V year according one report Major Chinese automakers BYD Xpeng Nio developed vehicles equipped super charging technology takes 15 minutes charge batteries 10 80 March 2025 BYD announced new charging system says deliver 400km 250 miles range five minutes charging making twice fast Tesla superchargers BYD plans roll network 4 000 flash charging stations across China Iris Liu electric car plugs charge charging station Beijing China rolling huge number fast chargers EVs Credit Iris Liu end 2026 13 million vehicles China expected equipped high voltage fast charging Overall range anxiety decreasing says Liu country accounted almost two thirds 17 million EVs sold globally 2024 surge driven China push reduce dependence imported oil establish global leadership green technologies ownership question another thing holding back battery swaps private vehicles China elsewhere Battery swaps inherently require car owners relinquish ownership particular battery car owner bought new car swaps battery motorway example likely receive older battery Many car companies aware issue adopted business model separating car battery consumers buy cars without batteries rent directly company companies developed mobile battery swap vehicles charge batteries locations lower electricity prices – Lulu Xue business model requires automakers manage large number batteries tying significant capital increasing financial risk Popularising battery swap stations also require automakers accept unified battery pack standard batteries interchanged freely says Jing Yang director Asia Pacific corporate ratings division Fitch Ratings credit rating agency based New York Carmakers however reluctant says mastering battery technologies important way maintain industry influence battery swaps would appear solve range anxiety currently always case Nio owner meet battery swap station near Beijing Olympic Sports Centre tells time swap battery indeed fast swap stations need reliably fully charged battery people line avoid long wait times says visiting suburbs almost missed important meeting back city fully charged batteries available Taxi swaps commercial vehicles heavy duty trucks taxis buses problems easier solve vehicles often operate predictable patterns centralised management fixed routes designated service areas making easier plan coordinate battery swaps efficiently Battery swapping heavy duty trucks currently widely promoted China government policies private companies says Lulu Xue mobility lead China office World Resources Institute global non profit purchase cost battery electric heavy duty trucks high first introduced batteries accounted large part says battery separated vehicle users buy vehicle body price almost purchase cost diesel trucks Iris Liu Chinese electric car company Nio built 3 300 battery swap stations China also developed vehicles equipped fast charging technology Credit Iris Liu Chinese government extended considerable financial assistance battery swapping schemes 2021 pilot programme three 11 cities primarily focusing battery swapping trucks provinces China also provided substantial financial incentives advancement battery swapping technology 2021 China Hainan Province announced one time subsidy 15 initial investment equipment battery swapping stations built put operation 2021 2022 like • EV batteries go die – reborn • bullet train power China ultra high voltage electricity grid • Asia 5 000 year old rice terraces inspiring modern flood control China able widely promote battery swap stations quickly since home main lithium ion battery manufacturers thus relatively inexpensive abundant supply batteries according Yihao Xie researcher heavy duty vehicles Washington based International Council Clean Transportation Using battery swaps commercial vehicles also obstacles however Swap stations occupy large area says Yang tends scarcity land power grid resources core areas needed constraint rapid expansion present battery swap operators tried deepen cooperation traditional energy companies obtain core resources adds However Liu points battery swap stations similar size petrol stations easily repurposed battery swaps China National Petroleum Corporation example already built charging battery replacement facilities gas stations Perks pitfalls companies also trying specialised methods Like many facilities China using land battery swap stations requires approval filing making entire cycle relatively long land rent also increases cost stations avoid companies developed mobile battery swap vehicles says Xue added benefit able charge batteries locations lower electricity prices swapping areas site charging would costly less feasible Liu notes commercial vehicles battery ownership concerns easier manage since companies purchase batteries bulk rely third party providers issue still affecting often least drivers vehicles use swap stations One taxi driver speak Beijing taxi charging battery swapping technology meaning choose charge swap batteries taxi company works stipulates drivers must use battery swap mode least month part trial get good battery change tells wait month changing Using battery swap service also expensive charging adds Getty Images California start Ample several partnerships around world use battery swap station technology Credit Getty Images Taxi drivers get battery poor battery life swap station sometimes quarrel staff according worker meet Beijing taxi swap station driver gets bad battery yell us tell yelling us help swap batteries drivers even say call police – happened many times Currently says Xue clear business model China battery swaps heavy duty trucks especially intensive short distance uses factories mines Xie agrees Battery swapping commercial vehicles especially heavy trucks still faster fastest charger technologies currently market says Trucks carry batteries much larger capacities slower charge much powerful chargers become available advantages unlikely weaken even fast charging technology develops adds Carbon Count emissions travel took report story 3kg CO2 digital emissions story estimated 1 2g 3 6g CO2 per page view Find calculated figure another potential reason develop battery swap stations use energy storage stations say Liu Xue Due variable nature renewables like solar wind booming China huge amount energy storage needed ensure stability power grid EV batteries including battery swap stations one way providing says Liu Battery swap companies could use batteries earn difference electricity prices peaks troughs says battery swap operators already eyeing opportunity far stations China elsewhere used way could provide another big benefit though says Xie supporting grid local distribution grids knocked extreme weather One hundred battery swap stations would equivalent 50MW energy storage power station notes one industry report Going global possible battery swaps may ever relatively niche offering China EVs charging infrastructure widespread countries struggled adopt EVs battery swaps may fact play useful role countries EVs yet popular Xie says especially Chinese EV manufacturers bring products technology abroad Battery swaps could still solve range anxiety China Battery swaps already explored outside China
