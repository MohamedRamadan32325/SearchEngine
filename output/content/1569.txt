almost oblivion particle less millimetre across Staff working Altilium recycling firm south west England tasked extracting crucial materials pitch black disorder powder contains plastic steel battery must separated also sought materials lithium nickel cobalt graphite prized ingredients lab workers make new battery climate crisis intensifies world electrifying Countries increasingly shifting away fossil fuels towards renewable sources energy including solar panels wind turbines Homeowners installing heat pumps place old gas oil boilers drivers increasingly buying electric vehicles EVs powered batteries According International Energy Agency IEA nearly one five cars sold 2023 electric 35 year year increase compared 2022 brought number EVs world roads 40 million problem demand batteries materials required make soaring One big challenges minerals kind concentrated certain places says Christian Marston president chief operating officer Altilium half world nickel comes Indonesia two thirds cobalt comes Democratic Republic Congo – ongoing human rights issues associated mining operations race find ways sourcing key minerals Recycling batteries one option also notoriously difficult

late 2020 got slow start lost two years Covid says Marston ruefully mid 2022 colleagues took lease Tavistock facility – time empty shed says chief technology officer Ben Wickham team built several laboratories began developing recycling process small scale Three years later commissioning larger plant outside nearby Plymouth supply recycled materials battery manufacturers company one handful firms around world developing methods recycling batteries sourced old EVs firms promise bring us one step closer net zero greenhouse gas emissions also closer circular economy almost nothing thrown away remove myth batteries go landfill says Marston EVs become popular reaching end useful lives means exhausted batteries aging vehicles become available Recycling batteries prevents expensive –

motivate efforts Li Cycle company established 2016 recovers critical materials lithium ion batteries plants Canada US Germany instance Hype meter lots companies working battery recycling technologies worth considering much progress actually made date Altilium credit actually manufactured battery cells using recycled materials end life electric vehicle batteries still far conveyor belt churning finished batteries ready consumer use Companies currently developing environmentally friendly forms battery recycling must show compete polluting established approaches pyrometallurgy Plus processing black mass old shredded batteries often occurs Asia today partly costs lower Redwood Materials US company campuses Northern Nevada South Carolina established 2017 one founders electric car company Tesla partnerships carmakers Toyota VW BMW older materials companies also started experimenting notably Texas based Ecobat Solutions many firms also investing battery recycling tech Despite interest however much progress made area current lithium ion battery recycling market still early industrial stage says Xiaochu Wei battery recycling researcher Imperial College London UK Last year German chemicals firm BASF paused work battery recycling plant Spain though company says still intends build facility Part challenge field complex batteries begin makes recycling tricky Every battery two main components cathode anode providing power say motor anode releases negatively charged electrons flow around circuit return battery absorbed cathode Electrons flow opposite direction battery

intermingled many dangerous several metals toxic people wildlife also pose fire explosion hazards Altilium battery shredding process recovers graphite originally anode alongside minerals Getting

solution step saw glass tubes full coloured liquids Wickham explains Altilium takes approach manufacturers constantly changing chemical makeup batteries Battery chemistry moving fast says Wickham argues battery companies increasingly rely nickel compared metals stores energy given volume emerging battery designs however moving away nickel high price tag separating individual metals Altilium aims supply battery manufacturers exact mixes want new cathodes goal create closed loop EV battery supply chain UK says Marston Getty Images Demand improved range faster recharging speeds meant electric vehicle battery technology developed rapidly Credit Getty Images Methods reduce old batteries component raw materials essential sustainable economies says Anna Hankin senior lecturer chemical engineering Imperial College London UK working project funded Altilium alongside Wei possible regenerate used batteries replacing chemicals lost individual components point process stop working says come point every battery components need shredded Besides easing transition net zero Marston argues recycling EV batteries take us step closer circular economy much possible raw materials would reused recycled endlessly would reduce need extractive industries mining often damage ecosystems pose risks human health case EV batteries instead mining lithium nickel metals ground keep reusing supplies already Researchers estimated 2040 half demand lithium nickel batteries could supplied recycling next five 10 years Wei says recycling could provide decent share raw materials needed make EV batteries – somewhere 10 40 estimates would help battery manufacturers redesigned batteries make easier recycling facilities separate key components adds recycling takes benefits could significant According 2024 IEA report greater recycling critical minerals could reduce need new mining much 40 mid century IEA notes many governments creating policies encourage recycling instance 2023 European Union introduced new Battery Regulation introduce increasingly stringent requirements recycling efficiency material recovery recycled content beginning 2025 environmentally friendly also geopolitical motivations last 20 years international order things significantly destabilised shocks Brexit policies US President Donald Trump impacting global trade international cooperation Countries overly dependent imports critical supplies face significant risks new world says Marston Altilium individual chemical components batteries recovered black mass powder series extraction steps Credit Altilium minerals used EV batteries increasingly important countries continue functioning future economies ones control critical minerals says Marston means countries like UK problem UK minerals scale Marston view recycling electric vehicle batteries ensures energy security see batteries country strategic asset UK says Instead sending abroad recycled – possibly country poor environmental labour laws – wants recycled domestically processing UK add value UK says challenge companies scale Altilium currently commissioning new larger plant able operate continuously proves successful company plans two progressively larger facilities battery recycling scale confidence produce material around 20 lower cost commercial material says Marston would look like 150 000 EV batteries per year essential
