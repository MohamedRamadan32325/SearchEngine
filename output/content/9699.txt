bankruptcy March VC backed genetic testing company Nucleus Genomics put hand acquire platform Nucleus uses whole genome testing give users fuller picture DNA company also recently released new feature raised eyebrows among ethicists Kian Sadeghi Nucleusâ founder CEO lays vision future genetic testing tells whole lot ancestors Episode Transcript Download Transcript Clare Duffy 00 00 04 23andMe filed bankruptcy recently lot questions resurfaced genetic testing Questions like send DNA company data go benefits tests worth potential privacy risks tackled questions episode back March episode aired heard CEO startup wants buy 23andMe Nucleus Genomics uses genetic testing assess people risks health conditions pitch technology sequences whole genome say give better understanding health Kian Sadeghi 00 00 43 look gene means basically provide analysis greater breadth conditions per disease basis provide far comprehensive analysis well Clare Duffy 00 00 54 wanted talk Nucleus CEO Kian Sadeghi vision company moment people rethinking genetic testing get take next industry Part next somewhat controversial feature Nucleus recently announced called Nucleus Family Using tool partner could sync DNA tests assess likelihood passing along health risks potential future children seems great first glance also raises thorny ethical questions family planning whether responsibly use information technology provide Clare Duffy Terms Service Clare Duffy 00 01 40 Thanks Kian Kian Sadeghi 00 01 41 Thank much excited Clare Duffy 00 01 43 dive deeply 25 right live New York City put trying use Nucleus find specific type partner Kian Sadeghi 00 01 56 Haha Clare Duffy 00 01 56 Tell genetics matter dating life Kian Sadeghi 00 01 59 Well turns actually Nucleus cystic fibrosis carrier know something actually knew way works basically genetic marker cystic fibrosis impact health could impact future child health assuming partner also carrier actually kind Nucleus kind partner feature add partner platform see whether risk significant passing know case cystic fibrosis thinking know single think well go date going like know go school done Nucleus test would prefer date someone also carrier cystic fibrosis obviously ever met know connection rather want risk passing future child Clare Duffy 00 02 52 Okay yeah going ask like happens meet future wife coffee shop love first sight Kian Sadeghi 00 02 57 great Clare Duffy 00 02 57 like take Nucleus test Kian Sadeghi 00 03 00 Yeah mean still meet love life turns carrier thing problem technology enables information basically pass specific disease think kind beauty genetics preventative nature actually give patients case couples knowledge basically stave future disease future child cheek swab right literally swab home get results portal know piece information save future baby life potentially think pretty amazing Clare Duffy 00 03 33 idea Nucleus originally come get interested genetic testing Kian Sadeghi 00 03 39 Unfortunately story Nucleus begins personal tragedy cousin actually went sleep one night wake next day Yeah died died sleep time almost seven asked parents happen know understand seven really understand sort things Clare Duffy 00 03 57 Yeah Kian Sadeghi 00 03 57 know parents said bad genetics mean idea eventually started studying genetics realized know disease viewed problem solved right necessarily need fact life Someone die 15 mean horrible actually started genetic engineering work sort love beauty depth biology actually went Penn study computational biology one day literally genetics class chairman biology department time pulled chart okay Look chart basically shows cost reading someone DNA find cost reading someone DNA come around 100 million time 2020 1 000 thought huh know 100 million per sample 1 000 per example crazy actually leave school actually move back bedroom Brooklyn literally filled around 18 subject notebooks basically computational genomics basically realized create world advanced DNA health test 70 000 genetic tests market right think DNA like thousand page book genetic tests expensive read thousand pages genetic test would look word maybe sentence maybe page many different tests test breast cancer test Alzheimer cystic fibrosis test another test Tay Sachs yet another test DNA affects metabolism drugs words tens thousands different tests looking different parts DNA book speak price come 100 million Nucleus provides couple hundred dollars actually combine 70 000 tests one test one swab Clare Duffy 00 05 39 Right Nucleus test starts 399 plus 39 per year membership talk going Nucleus customer get test happens sort walk process Kian Sadeghi 00 05 55 Yeah go mynucleus com basically fill information independent physician network reviews order physician network approves DNA kit comes DNA kit basically cheek swab swab cheeks stick tube send tube lab lab basically extract DNA process comes raw DNA file raw DNA files runs models algorithms couple weeks later log account see basically results today 900 different conditions Clare Duffy 00 06 27 give us examples Kian Sadeghi 00 06 28 get analysis Clare Duffy 00 06 29 Yeah Kian Sadeghi 00 06 29 huge range get analysis things like cancers like gastric cancer breast cancer way neuroderm diseases like Alzheimer Parkinson ways things like diabetes even psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia course rare diseases like mentioned cystic fibrosis example Clare Duffy 00 06 49 value comprehensive look DNA like rather sort regular things people might worried like Alzheimer give people much information Kian Sadeghi 00 07 01 Well patients like right went clinic today would recommended get genetic tests entire thesis genetics actually want get symptoms condition first get genetic test Clare Duffy 00 07 14 Right Kian Sadeghi 00 07 14 kind defeats purpose right unfortunately kind complex today moreover find family history bad measure many studies show basically lot cases people family history medical records might even family history properly transmitted words really way knowing risk could genes Clare Duffy 00 07 35 Okay understand medical information like cystic fibrosis risk know Nucleus also provides information know risk alcoholism intelligence information Talk value pieces information Kian Sadeghi 00 07 53 Well think really believe empowering patients customers information use live longer healthier lives even understand much deeper Alcoholism great example actually great customer case Nucleus discovered 99 percentile genetic risk alcoholism beautiful customer anecdote said alcoholism running family generations everyone felt guilty Everyone blamed know almost like idea viewing kind addiction like disease versus addiction something lack kind mental power fortitude said test Nucleus actually discovering actually much gracious Clare Duffy 00 08 41 Nucleus looking acquire 23andMe existing customer genetic data Instead Kian says interested subsidiary 23andMe called Lemonade Health telehealth platform offers doctor consultations prescriptions medications online Kian Sadeghi 00 09 01 like Lemonade Health 23 vision never materialized really good one actually someone really needs build sort integrated health platform consumer centric real time quantified combines genetics blood drugs full body MRIs everything entirety someone health data onto single application got combine someone drugs DNA find different genetic markers basically affect people metabolism different drugs differently still baffling like unbelievable people put pieces together course take lemonade Health basically bunch different drugs two things One depending people risk conditions could clinically appropriate recommend someone take drug end actually adjust right dosage patient Lemonade Health interesting us world building kind health stack speak thing reality 23andMe brand tarnished still well known genetics company interested thinking kind secure genetic future bring back trust privacy genetic testing really wanna build software stops happened cousin happen anyone world really want privacy security get way Nucleus HIPAA compliant 23 never HIPPA complient medical provider CLIA certified CAPA credited words follow infrastructure exists health information Clare Duffy 00 10 30 know HIPAA law requires health care providers get patient consent sharing sensitive health information Kian says Nucleus required follow HIPPA provider medical tests Kian Sadeghi 00 10 44 give medical grade insight medical provider medical laboratory approved United States sort analysis Clare Duffy 00 10 53 23andMe filed bankruptcy seen users really concerned going happen data going acquire data think people concerned used service Kian Sadeghi 00 11 04 would say couple things First would say cannot say loudly enough regulations place notably GINA Genetic Information Non Discrimination Act passed 2008 basically makes illegal employers health insurance companies use genetic data first important point protections place said also would say know recommend 23andMe user would probably download data know makes feel comfortable could request delete 23andMe servers well Clare Duffy 00 11 37 Kian says unlike 23andMe company like Nucleus HIPAA compliant gets sold customer data would continue protected way Kian Sadeghi 00 11 47 People always talk genetics context applies health data health system hospital company went could actually know owner follow regulations HIPAA basically data going used provide care Clare Duffy 00 12 02 saying hopefully happen thing happen Nucleus company succeed people concerns 23andMe Kian Sadeghi 00 12 12 Nucleus follows HIPAA acquiring company would follow HIPPA yes exactly correct Clare Duffy 00 12 19 people people might familiar HIPAA exactly involves want ask people wondering Nucleus share data third party advertisers researchers anything like Kian Sadeghi 00 12 33 default share genetic data protected health information third party Sometimes customers come us say look grandfather Alzheimer wanna help advance Alzheimer research customer right choice share data want researcher way view Clare Duffy 00 12 55 Kian says medical information genetic testing helpful tool thinking future planning start family thinking kids questions consider syncing genetic data break Clare Duffy 00 13 23 Nucleus backed big names tech world including Peter Thiel Founders Fund Reddit co founder Alexis Ohanian 776 Fund geneticists ethicists also raised big questions red flags kind technology worry could give people unrealistic impression much genetics contribute future health personality outcomes especially future children also worry discrimination based genetics wanted hear Kian sees technology Nucleus recently launched Nuclease Family option somebody partner upload DNA different expect used differently Nucleus offered Kian Sadeghi 00 14 16 Well think know going back book analogy DNA thousand page book see really natural evolution genomics industry actually read thousand pages reason separate genetic tests separate different applications makes sense bring every application one umbrella principally think Nucleus preventive health company really know reason give someone diseases assessment cancer also give insight helps healthy children Clare Duffy 00 14 47 Yeah going ask couple trying conceive thinking conceiving lot times go get certain genetic tests doctor covered insurance mean good insurance good insurance probably afford Nucleus either like use Nucleus instead Kian Sadeghi 00 15 08 different kinds preconception testing right might look one gene might look two genes took like best clinical genetics company look total number genes look right think around 400 look 500 genes use whole genome fundamentally limited basically oh one gene two genes 10 genes 20 genes look whole thing means identify far genetic markers parents could pass child reason important look babies born hereditary disease think statistic like 80 known family history idea second start saying oh subpopulation oh know get tested know maybe Jewish oh actually get tested Tay Sachs something second start actually miss huge number genetic markers may could also pass child kind way think Clare Duffy 00 16 12 think usable sex couples Obviously slightly different Kian Sadeghi 00 16 16 Well actually interestingly interesting conversation Nucleus weather allow sex know even though obviously practically speaking work lot theory could still work new science coming actually take like stem cell example know Maybe actually sex couple make like sperm know egg example actually think future coming sex couples able use DNA children think beautiful awesome Also build even sophisticated simulations people babies well necessarily dependent male female necessarily need opposite Currently today try matchmake Nucleus sex break sex specific disease linked models obviously assume know whatever X XX would break models necessarily allow today something actually thought lot Clare Duffy 00 17 09 hope future home genetic testing Kian Sadeghi 00 17 12 think genetics going moving ancestry genealogy future DNA health test basically mentioned cost come 10 million couple hundred dollars think next five years going tens dollars literally 10 20 dollars going go buy candy bar going buy whole genome kit think gonna see everyone world going get DNA health test going enable kind level precision medicine basically seen much targetly give people recommendations get screenings different medical interventions specifically take know healthiest family possible drug dosages best right price going keep crashing People going basically use genetics going integrated standards medical care gonna like blood test right go checkup get blood tests get genetic test done Clare Duffy 00 18 07 talked GINA law prevents employers health insurers using genetics Kian Sadeghi 00 18 13 going say apply life insurance companies apply long turn disability care Yeah Clare Duffy 00 18 17 Well heard stories folks getting denied long term disability care asked taken genetic test worry Kian Sadeghi 00 18 24 think couple things One think GINA expanded cover life insurance well long term disability care Two think really hard reason hard exact kinds genetic markers would someone denied long term disability care exact kind genetic markers want know Right Right someone sometimes oh know genetic marker get know long time disability care also genetic marker might save life know test God forbid know get dilatating disease know man horrible right Imagine known actually prevent really really tricky scenario think GINA expanded think patients get long term disability care life insurance genetic tests Clare Duffy 00 19 11 would recommend first Kian Sadeghi 00 19 13 want get get life insurance want genetic test think GINA expanded think everyone feel comfortable genetic tests Nucleus hopes bring kind medical grade quality scale everyone access Clare Duffy 00 19 27 Yeah fact traits dependent environment lifestyle factors related genetics Like alcoholism one thinking certainly imagine genetic markers would indicate imagine also dependent culture time life Kian Sadeghi 00 19 46 Yeah absolutely Clare Duffy 00 19 46 people think understanding genetic information knowing necessarily gonna tell everything future children Kian Sadeghi 00 19 55 Absolutely great point really important say think like two things Let say height ask someone height genetically driven biologically driven probably say genetically driven right makes sense take something like personality trait like extraversion less genetically driven right Height around 80 percent extraversion think like 10 percent attributed genetics words built perfect genetic model perfectly predictive would still error course would environment like bad thing something great mean error life reality build models tell tendencies averages still going error thing think one underappreciated parts platform actually take entire genome combine age sex BMI words relevant non genetic clinical factors combine together overall risk Let give great example sometimes go doctor recently actually unfortunately high LDL Clare Duffy 00 20 57 Tell people LDL Kian Sadeghi 00 20 58 basically bad cholesterol associated increase heart disease Okay got blood test doctor said oh know high risk heart disease thing ask doctor mean doctor say without fail well depends genetics depends much work depends tall depends BMI depends factors challenge opportunity Nucleus say depend factors look heart disease model combine entirety genome combine total cholesterol combine BMI combine sex combine age actually build integrated models gives overall risk assessments turns even average cholesterol genetics good shape et cetera whatever turns risk heart disease overall risk actually low future medicine right beauty actually building integrated models start going fuzzy models building far sophisticated statistical models gives complete holistic assessment someone unique risk disease take steps basically prevent bring condition Clare Duffy 00 22 15 Services especially talk family piece services offer help people weed genetic risk even give people information IQ level things like drawn comparison eugenics concerns disabled people discriminated idea good genes bad genes would say concerns Kian Sadeghi 00 22 38 would say look preconception testing American College Gynecologists Obstetricians actually recommend every woman wants children words good science good medicine really believe great clinical science great genetic science really believe also giving couples information liberty choose right Maybe someone carrier cystic fibrosis choose IVF choose baby without cystic fibrosis right choice Maybe care cystic fibrosis meaning genetic marker decide kids mind risk wanna kids organically speak also choice right view giving people super high quality unoptimatically relevant genetic information letting patient appropriate genetic counselors also physicians decide wanna information empowerment patient empowerment Clare Duffy 00 23 37 record American College Obstetricians Gynecologists recommends information carrier screening provided couples pregnant hoping stops short recommending whether actually screening except case family history select conditions Clare Duffy 00 23 59 Knowing early days curious like look forward 10 20 years say give people choice curious way know social media platforms say people use platform however want choice seen lead genocide attacks Capitol worry saying going give people choice could lead dangerous choices Kian Sadeghi 00 24 27 Well job rigorously thoughtfully give information patients right words like let look something like IQ example right brought IQ course IQ completely genetic determinists course course matters free end day word said earlier height extraversion applies actually trait even build perfect model error bug feature life beautiful part life DNA part picture often think know people talk genetics two extremes horoscope real people say like wow interesting okay sure Right real Gattaca deterministic model Genetics something everything never everything Clare Duffy 00 25 23 Okay something personally curious feel like kind person maybe rather know kind would like life unfold however going unfold wrong Like dumb Kian Sadeghi 00 25 35 think one analogy like use sometimes like let say month going get plane going crash give piece information stressed right know would say say thank God knew going plane words rare genetic marker could dramatically increase risk condition may short term stress Admittedly support genetic counselors support doctors support entire medical system God forbid get plane mean say like gonna think course like Clare Duffy 00 26 09 know get plane 00 26 11 Right like gonna tell hey month gonna happen horoscope looked horoscope saw plane gonna crash know going gonna get plane know course right think fair Clare Duffy 00 26 21 Yeah Kian Sadeghi 00 26 21 Like going get plane right course like thank God telling Clare Duffy 00 26 25 like 60 years know God forbid going develop ALS something currently cure Kian Sadeghi 00 26 32 Well thing ALS like let say Alzheimer might cure today tomorrow often find patients like give Alzheimer score even young like 25 something reason otherwise would idea even pay attention right like knew high risk Alzheimer know next several decades right going paying attention cutting edge research diagnostics know drugs et cetera coming also even different lifestyle measures whatever supplements take basically prevent condition happening obviously know way things advancing especially AI know get much better course know something exists could possibly prevent beauty think knowledge really power Clare Duffy 00 27 18 Well sure hopefully keep talking continues develop Kian thank Kian Sadeghi 00 27 23 Thank much Clare Duffy 00 27 27 talking Kian feels clear consumer genetic testing dying 23andMe bankruptcy anything technology impact lives evolving rapidly idea future medicine personalized patients control often opaque healthcare ecosystem could exciting depend whole bunch people using technology responsibly things think would useful keep mind considering using one services First even whole DNA tests like Nucleus genetics tell everything future health risk future children ditto personality traits like IQ information useful remember humans complex beings genetics one many factors make us family history think might risk specific condition might want consider obtaining something like life insurance taking genetic test prevent risk might turned away charged genetic condition road Since Kian said US Genetic Nondiscrimination Act currently cover life long term disability insurance Nucleus tests paid FSA HSA funds also worth remembering concerned specific genetic risk may able access testing covered insurance doctor might comprehensive whole DNA testing money tight might good place start week episode Terms Service
