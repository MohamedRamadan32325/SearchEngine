clinched second Premier League title also resulted something curious – producing strange series numbers league record books Something remarkable happened English football Liverpool FC crowned Premier League champions second time added 18 pre Premier League titles means equal Manchester United record English champions 20 times fans club doubt celebrating moment triumph another astounding facet achievement caught attention mathematicians Liverpool title win completed opening exceptional set numbers 33 years making sequence emerges rank Liverpool alongside clubs Premier League since first formed 1992 listing number titles starting lowest see table number Premier League titles goes follows 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 Clubs Premier League ranked many Premier League titles least Credit BBC untrained eye sequence might seem significant enough get many maths aficionados excited recognise Fibonacci sequence number first two sum previous two sequence sequence found astonishing array places – spirals seeds sunflower heads bracts pinecones family tree patterns species animals Fibonacci sequences sequences plural starting different pair initial numbers following rule adding consecutive numbers generate next gives different related sequence first introduced European science 1202 Leonardo Pisa also known nickname Fibonacci meaning son Bonaccio Long Fibonacci popularised sequences book Liber Abaci however sequences known Indian Mathematicians drawn upon sequences help enumerate number possible poems given length using short syllables one unit duration long syllables two unit duration Indian poet mathematicians knew could make poem length n taking poem length n 1 adding short syllable poem length n 2 adding long syllable Consequently figured work number poems given length add number poems one syllable shorter number two syllables shorter – exact rule use today define Fibonacci sequence Hidden sequences another important related mathematical mainstay – golden ratio terms Fibonacci sequence get larger ratio term one preceding gets closer closer golden ratio – approximated 1 61803 first places decimal expansion golden ratio hypothesised govern arrangement leaves stem plant species supposedly leads aesthetically pleasing results applied art architecture music Fibonacci sequences often held mathematicians exemplars beauty mathematics provide vivid visual examples maths written patterns real world without many non mathematicians struggle understand elegance see subject enthusiasm proselytise however temptation cast Fibonacci sequences golden ratio sort encompassing natural law governing phenomena across orders magnitude spiral shapes nautilus shells vortices hurricanes curved arms galaxies reality although natural features aesthetically pleasing conform rules Fibonacci sequence exhibit golden ratio must careful try shoehorn every beautiful pattern delicate Fibonacci glass slipper – suggest causation impose meaning none Getty Images Fibonacci sequences found wide range natural phenomena including heads sunflowers Credit Getty Images Coincidence extraordinary find Fibonacci sequence cropping place unexpected Premier League scientists spot well known sequence like appearing seemingly blue start ask whether tells us anything important process generated sequence surprising unseen process underlying Premier League title battles nothing cute coincidence see Fibonacci sequence something mean reason Nonetheless spotting sorts seeming coincidences extremely useful process scientific discovery 1912 example Alfred Wegener noticed apparently strange coincidence coastline West Africa eastern coastline South America seemed fit together like pieces jigsaw puzzle Despite prevailing opinion time enormous land masses continents big move Wegener proposed theory reconciled observations Continental drift suggested land masses rooted place could ever slowly change relative positions surface Earth like strange maths work Tour de France three body problem search random numbers Wegener published theory 1915 became laughing stock Geologists rejected outlandish idea citing lack mechanism moving enormous chunks Earth surface dismissing seemingly snug tessellation continents pure coincidence 1960s however theory plate tectonics – movement solid mantle crust Earth surface – gave credence Wegener widely accepted theories Alamy Leonardo Pisa – better known Fibonacci – drew work Indian Islamic mathematicians Credit Alamy evolution mistake Although coincidences point way new scientific discoveries also prove obstacle scientific progress appear confirm incorrect theory early 1800s German anatomist Johann Friedrich Meckel made blunder believer scala naturae ladder nature humans sit animals ordered static hierarchy simplest primitive life forms supposed sit lowest rungs ladder complex advanced beings resided highest views hardly surprising given great chain predominant theory day generally accepted theory common descent – multiple species descend single ancestral population – infancy idea time Meckel employed scala naturae come conjecture area speciality – embryonic development Known recapitulation theory posited developed embryos higher order animals like mammals progressed successively forms strongly resembled less perfect animals like fish amphibians reptiles lower rungs ladder One startling seemingly unlikely prediction theory humans progressed fish stage embryos would gill slits happens discovered 1827 human embryos really slits resemble gills early stage development extraordinary finding seemed bear Meckel prediction corroborate recapitulation theory strong perceived evidence theory became widely accepted almost 50 years later 1870s recapitulation theory development finally put bed good idea common descent started take hold Common descent underpins know modern evolutionary theory made clear far undergoing fish stage womb gill slits consequence fact sharing common ancestor fish also share much DNA early developmental processes Sometimes coincidences lead scientists astray seeming point one conclusion fact alternative explanation observations better supported facts fact beautiful almost mystical Fibonacci sequence cropped data number Premier League title wins mean beautiful game plausible mechanism could given rise sequence answer almost certainly nothing wonderful spotted mathematical sequence unlikely place giving us chance reflect upon importance Fibonacci numbers pattern always mean causality – coincidence sometimes coincidence like Meckel gill
