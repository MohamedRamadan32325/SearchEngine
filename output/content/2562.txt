Climate Science Parts Spain hit torrential rain two weeks flooding killed 220 people Like extreme weather events episodes heavy rainfall becoming common intense many places around world driven climate change four ways rising temperatures affecting weather extremes simple guide climate change 1 extreme rain every 1C rise average temperature atmosphere hold around 7 moisture external moisture available rainfall become heavier Scientists use computer models simulate individual extreme weather events unfold two scenarios today world around 1 2C human caused warming hypothetical world without human influence climate way estimate external much particular storm heatwave drought affected climate change October 2023 March 2024 UK experienced second wettest period record level rainfall made least four times likely human caused warming according scientists World Weather Attribution group WWA September 2024 deadly floods hit much central Europe including Poland Czech Republic Romania Austria Italy intensity rainfall four days mid September made twice likely climate change WWA says Climate change also likely played part heavy rainfall seen Spain late October early November Scientists point influence rising temperatures although full study needed evaluate exactly much influence climate change compared naturally fluctuating weather patterns Globally heavy rainfall events become frequent intense land regions due human activity according UN climate body IPCC external says pattern continue warming 2 Hotter longer heatwaves Even small increase average temperatures makes big difference heat extremes range daily temperatures shifts warmer levels hotter days become likely intense April 2024 temperatures Mali rose 48C extreme heatwave across Sahel region Africa linked increased hospitalisations deaths level heat would possible without human caused climate change according WWA temperature spikes become common many places external world continues warm UK temperatures topped 40C first time record July 2022 causing extensive disruption would extremely unlikely without climate change WWA said Heatwaves happen result heat domes external created area high pressure stays area days weeks trapping hot air underneath One theory suggests higher temperatures Arctic warmed nearly four times faster global average external affecting fast band winds high atmosphere known jet stream could making heat domes likely UK getting hotter Life 50 degrees 3 Longer droughts Linking climate change specific individual droughts difficult lots different factors affect availability water Natural weather systems example play key role case drought southern Africa early 2024 Image source Getty Images Image caption Many countries southern Africa experienced prolonged dry period early part 2024 climate change shifting global rainfall patterns world getting wetter parts becoming drier make prone drought heatwaves fuelled climate change worsen dry conditions occur increasing evaporation soil makes air warm quickly leading intense heat periods hot weather increased demand water especially farmers puts even stress water supply parts East Africa five failed rainy seasons external row 2020 2022 region suffered worst drought 40 years displaced 1 2 million people Somalia external alone Climate change made droughts like least 100 times likely according WWA Human caused warming also main driver drought Amazon rainforest second half 2023 region worst drought since modern records began 4 fuel wildfires Fires happen naturally many parts world external difficult know climate change caused worsened specific wildfire factors also relevant changes way land used climate change making weather conditions needed wildfires spread likely IPCC says external Extreme long lasting heat draws moisture soils vegetation tinder dry conditions provide fuel fires spread incredible speed particularly winds strong Canada experienced far worst wildfire season record 2023 Image source Reuters Image caption Canada experienced far worst wildfire year record 2023 Climate change doubled likelihood extreme fire weather conditions eastern Canada May June 2023 helped fires spread WWA says external Rising temperatures may also increase likelihood lightning world northernmost forests turn trigger fires combined effects shifting land use climate change mean extreme wildfires projected become frequent intense globally according UN Environment Programme UNEP external number extreme fires may rise 50 2100 UNEP suggests wildfires start Related topics Floods COP29 Drought
