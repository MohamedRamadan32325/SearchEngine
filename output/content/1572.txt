Advanced Transport BloombergNEF US ramps efforts onshore lithium ion battery supply chain uncomfortable truth emerging world awash battery manufacturing capacity it’s going make life difficult new entrants BloombergNEF estimates lithium ion battery demand across EVs stationary storage came around 950 gigawatt hours last year Global battery manufacturing capacity twice close 2 600 GWh China’s battery production 2023 alone similar global demand US alone trying increase share global battery market Canada matching US incentives Europe India others also awarding subsidies grow battery industries means oversupply picture going get worse gets better BNEF tracking 7 9 TWh annual battery manufacturing capacity announced end 2025 That’s compared demand projections 1 6 TWh even assumes steady EV demand growth rapid growth batteries storage applications Even half total announced capacity would enough equip almost every car sold world next year 50 kWh battery pack quite lot announced capacity simply won’t come online Much either behind schedule outright cancelled realities scaling become clearer list contenders thins parts supply chain able deliver level can’t perfectly match supply demand anyway EV batteries yet commodity product different formats chemistries factors consider including automaker preferences planned model launches Plants also don’t typically run intended capacity utilization rates falling last years Still even hefty de rating factor much actually comes online market heading even serious oversupply several big implications first prices fall margins get squeezed That’s already happening 14 dip average battery pack prices 2023 China’s CATL announcing expects able sell battery cells equivalent less 60 per kWh year Average capacity utilization existing plants also continue fall dropping 2023 Battery prices also converging across sectors manufacturers look new markets products years ago commercial vehicle batteries cost much going passenger cars since trucks vans represented much lower volumes therefore less buying power gap narrowed market swung favor buyers continue close overcapacity issue grows That’s good news electric truck makers Low prices make difficult new entrants compete even generous support provided US Inflation Reduction Act means Getting factory built one thing production phase involves whole new set challenges including cutting scrappage rates typically start high gradually come time There’s scenario even battery makers receiving generous support US Europe undercut Chinese rivals Part current market leaders don’t really fit bill complacent incumbent waiting disrupted Quite contrary — China’s BYD CATL continue invest billions R steadily launching new better products general behaving like scrappy startups bloated corporate fiefdoms good consumers lower prices starting reach EVs time many cheaper models planned launch 2025 2026 Even models year looking compelling recently released Xiaomi SU7 EV using CATL’s new battery technology boasting 830 kilometers 516 miles range equivalent 34 000 China stationary storage market already growing rapidly also benefit Taken together battery supply dynamics acting moderating factor happens demand side equation EV demand slows battery prices fall leading lower prices helping spur recovery demand biggest question sustainable low battery prices industry shakeout invariably comes overcapacity current prices simply driven lower raw material costs things like lithium also oversupplied right may hold long since it’s easier build battery plant bring new mining refining capacity price cuts also likely due established players looking protect market share force smaller ones there’s definitely element technology manufacturing improvement play well
