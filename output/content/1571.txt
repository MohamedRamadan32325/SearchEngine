Doan says kind local knowledge also play significant role helping modern communities maintain biodiversity ecosystems well responding climate change says Yu agrees global warming brings heavier downpours Europe example use terraced rice fields could even transplanted cities like London says slope slanting surface turned nature filled terraces absorb rainwater Wake calls Asian cities – many vast densely populated – started rethinking rainwater management strategies recent years face double whammy decades breakneck urbanisation climate change Kongjian Yu Turenscape Yanweizhou park Jinhua China rice terrace like bank planted grasses adapt underwater environments reduce flooding Credit Kongjian Yu Turenscape many places monsoon downpours getting intense typhoons becoming destructive sea levels rising cities like Jakarta Ho Chi Minh City also sinking rapidly due loss groundwater weight buildings many cities rainwater cannot penetrate paved surfaces means soil underneath chance soak store rainwater contribute natural water cycle system says Lei Yanhui teaching fellow urban planning design Xi Jiaotong Liverpool University Suzhou China Moreover cities drainage systems separate rainwater sewage prone overloading overflowing storms Lei says problem occurs UK explained recent article country’s struggle sewage pollution summer 2012 year Thailand massive flooding extreme downpours pounded Beijing resulting record breaking 460mm 18in rain space 18 hours event caused 79 deaths around 1 6bn £1 2bn damages like • ancient skywells keeping Chinese homes cool • houses built survive floods • environmental cost China addiction cement crisis marked watershed moment China started pay proper attention urban rainwater drainage flood prevention says Shao Zhiyu professor urban

retention pond total able hold million gallons 4 5 million litres water – roughly equivalent 1 5 Olympic size swimming pools Building urban resilience way us survive says Voraakhom Plants vs pipes nature based solutions – embodied green infrastructure like rice terraced inspired river banks urban parks trees green roofs – gather limelight debates whether really handle relentless storms compared conventional grey infrastructure dams pipes Wang Yuhong professor engineering Hong Kong Polytechnic University thinks green infrastructure meaningful supplement grey infrastructure applied suitable geographies Designs based rice terraces says could benefit cities mountains Hong Kong rainwater wash steep slopes rapidly Famous urban jungle view top Victoria Peak Hong Kong built huge concrete tunnel intercept rainwater mid levels island drain sea prevent city centre inundated rain collecting method expensive Wang notes project completed 2012 cost nearly 3 9 billion Hong Kong dollars £390m 504m copy rice terrace principle retain rainwater mid levels different ways building rain gardens many cities would economical method Still idea could costly technically challenging emissions intensive places require concrete structures constructed ground mimic slopes adds fact bringing kind green infrastructure world densest cities easy Asian cities compact therefore hard find large

massive underground vaults store stormwater Hong Kong Tokyo done Wang says team also working solution allow cities store rainwater roads using porous paving stones artificial facilities underground storage tanks drawbacks Lei points isolated cannot help much establishing natural rainwater recycle system based rice terraces Shao says green infrastructure show obvious effects flattening peak flood levels types high rainfalls seen every three five years severe storms occur ten years still need rely grey infrastructure urban drainage pump stations flood gates says Sponge city infrastructure also combined mechanisms reduce flooding however notes Shao example systematic urban planning divert floodwaters main roads less important roads city still perform basic functions particularly rescue tasks flooding adds Carbon Count emissions travel took report story 0kg CO2 digital emissions story estimated 1 2g 3 6g CO2 per page view Find calculated figure Yu sponge city concept total rejection grey infrastructure says cities prioritise using green infrastructure really impossible use pipes Beyond discussions green grey infrastructure however many agree cities need take leaf ancestors experience adapting natural world changes Instead fearing blocking floods humans befriend water” move forward unpredictable climate Yu says means cities redesign low lying areas – turning terraced wetlands –
