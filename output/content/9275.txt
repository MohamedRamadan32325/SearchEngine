International Space Station example lucky said Dr Bijunath Patla theoretical physicist US National Institute Standards Technology phone interview Though space station orbits 200 miles 322 kilometers Earth’s surface also travels high speeds — looping planet 16 times per day — effects relativity somewhat cancel Patla said reason astronauts orbiting laboratory easily use Earth time stay schedule missions — it’s simple Fortunately scientists already decades experience contending complexities Spacecraft example equipped clocks called oscillators Gramling said “They maintain time ” Gramling said “And operations spacecraft — even spacecraft way Pluto Kuiper Belt like New Horizons — rely ground stations back Earth everything they’re correlate UTC ” Astronauts International Space Station use Earth time stay schedule NASA spacecraft also rely kept time Gramling said Vehicles exploring deep solar system example know — based time scale — approaching planet case spacecraft needs use planetary
