Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — Researchers say uncovered evidence early Earth home hydrogen previously thought calling question widely held beliefs origins water evolution planet Scientists University Oxford analyzed rare type meteorite known enstatite chondrite space rock dates around 4 6 billion years ago believed similar composition early Earth according study published Wednesday journal Icarus illustration shows hycean world – exoplanet liquid water ocean beneath hydrogen rich atmosphere orbiting red dwarf star Based observations James Webb

PARTY Smith N Madhusudhan University Cambridge Reuters Related article Scientists detect signature life distant planet study suggests researchers found majority hydrogen contained within meteorite intrinsic rather present due contamination suggesting early Earth would home sufficient hydrogen allowed formation water molecules finding calls question widely held belief hydrogen arrived Earth asteroids bombarded previously dry rocky planet incapable supporting life “We assumed Earth water today quite lucky scenario hit asteroids ” lead study author Tom Barrett doctoral student department Earth sciences University Oxford told CNN Wednesday “But we’ve demonstrated study actually material formed Earth first instance actually contain lot hydrogen oxygen ” added “The discovery hydrogen meteorite means Earth potentially could hydrated wet initial formation ” levels hydrogen identified study previously hadn’t detected Barrett explained chemical element hard measure particularly low concentrations detection possible thanks technique known X ray Absorption Near Edge Structure XANES spectroscopy said enstatite chondrite rare type meteorite believed similar composition early Earth NASA “To need particle accelerator ” said “This like enormous really expensive facility we’ve fortunate used study it’s exactly kind experiment garage ” study potentially upends understanding early Earth discovery hydrogen meteorite doesn’t mean life would necessarily evolved sooner Barrett said habitability planet may depend way evolves material formed said Hydrogen early Earth team scientists French National Centre Scientific Research previously analyzed meteorite known LAR 12252 collected Antarctica August 2020 study found space rock’s chondrules minuscule spherical objects organic material contained within traces hydrogen research however accounted portion hydrogen within meteorite researchers behind new study believed hydrogen could attached sulphur within meteorite team unexpectedly detected hydrogen sulphide within fine matrix immediately surrounding chondrules — “on average almost 10 times more” hydrogen sulphide found spherical objects according study “We incredibly excited analysis told us sample contained hydrogen sulphide — expected ” Barrett said statement “Because likelihood hydrogen sulphide originating terrestrial contamination low research provides vital evidence support theory water Earth native — natural outcome planet made ” role asteroid comet impacts Next Barrett plans analyze meteorites effort ascertain exactly much hydrogen would present Earth much may delivered external sources Working Earth came look way today fundamental question planetary scientists said study coauthor James Bryson associate professor department Earth sciences University Oxford “We think material built planet — study using rare meteorites — far richer hydrogen thought previously ” said “This finding supports idea formation water Earth natural process rather fluke hydrated asteroids bombarding planet formed ” Matt Genge planetary scientist Imperial College London involved study told CNN study “interesting result ” evidence sufficient

thousands years said impossible completely rule chance hydrogen may formed time “Just fact possibility makes argument less strong ” Genge said Bryson acknowledged meteorite indeed likely Earth many years collected stands study results “We believe taken every effort analysis workflow mitigate impact terrestrial water results think total amount H hydrogen meteorite due Earth’s water maybe 15 ” Bryson said via email response Genge’s statement “We also think H hydrogen still delivered asteroids comets however think small proportion total H hydrogen found throughout planet Matt’s assessment
