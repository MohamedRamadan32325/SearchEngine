considered dangerous human health Leonard Ortiz MediaNews Group Orange County Register Getty Images CNN — group potentially toxic “ forever chemicals ” mostly coming prescribed drugs may contaminating drinking water millions Americans wastewater treatment plants fail remove — climate change may making situation even worse according new report Scientists analyzed water samples flowing eight large publicly owned wastewater plants across US similar size using similar technologies serving 70 population Even advanced treatment technologies found forever chemicals compounds able transform discharged rivers lakes reenter drinking water supply Roughly 23 million Americans could exposed forever chemicals wastewater alone study found “We’re identifying really large amounts chemicals know little ” said Bridger Ruyle environmental engineering scientist NYU author study published Monday Proceedings National Academy Sciences especially concerning treated wastewater expected make increasing proportion drinking water supplies climate change fueled drought shrinks water sources Ruyle told CNN Forever chemicals called ability stay environment — people’s bodies — long time without breaking nearly 15 000 known collectively PFAS perfluoroalkyl polyfluoroalkyl substances Since 1950s PFAS used huge range consumer products prized ability resist oil grease heat water make clothes waterproof carpets stain resistant pans non stick prolific use come cost Even low levels linked range health conditions including thyroid problems infertility cancers Groundwater flows pump near Winterhaven California May 26 2023 Mario Tama Getty Images Related article Toxic ‘forever’ chemicals found excessive levels global groundwater study says People exposed PFAS many ways drinking water important one Almost half tap water US contaminated according 2023 study Wastewater treatment plants play major role Ruyle said receive PFAS contaminated water homes industry 50 drinking water plants US downstream one added 2024 Environmental Protection Agency introduced rules dramatically reduce concentrations six PFAS drinking water However study found chemicals EPA regulates made 8 potentially hazardous compounds found water samples analyzed majority comprised unregulated chemicals including PFAS pharmaceuticals Drug companies use compounds classified PFAS hard degrade Ruyle said increase concentration drugs people’s bodies that’s advantage effectiveness drugs it’s problem everywhere else molecule that’s hard degrade body also hard degrade wastewater plant rivers lakes Ruyle said Pools water visible wastewater treatment plant San Rafael California Justin Sullivan Getty Images study also found climate change could increase exposure Lakes rivers shrink drought amount wastewater humans produce Ruyle said means less natural water dilute chemicals wastewater enters drinking water plants many parts country especially susceptible drought water reuse already important source drinking water said David Andrews acting chief science officer Environmental Working Group monitors exposure chemicals including PFAS “These water systems particularly vulnerable ” said Andrews involved study “This study highlights wastewater treatment plants currently equipped clean contamination ” told CNN Related article limit PFAS drinking water food according experts Denis O’Carroll professor civil environmental engineering University New South Wales also involved research said study “suggests many PFAS go undetected using traditional laboratory methods ” told CNN analysis consistent recent research found PFAS levels surface groundwater around world underestimated study also significant quantifies different sources PFAS wastewater treatment plants finds pharmaceuticals “may concern ” said It’s important understand sources PFAS order reduce added Much research still needed Ruyle said “There really large universe PFAS much prevalent found major sources need get understanding health risks ” said actions people take including filtering tap water experts say best solution find ways stop PFAS entering environment first place “We need address problem source ” Ruyle said “rather
