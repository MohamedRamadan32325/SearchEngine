crushing atmospheric pressure clouds corrosive acid NASA JPL Caltech Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — piece Soviet vehicle malfunctioned en route Venus 50 years ago due crash back Earth soon week Much piece space debris called Cosmos 482 also spelled Kosmos 482 unknown Though projections estimate object reenter atmosphere around May 10 unknowns exact shape size — well unpredictability space weather — make degree uncertainty inevitable It’s also unclear portion vehicle set reenter though researchers believe probe “entry capsule ” designed survive extreme temperature pressure landing Venus — atmosphere 90 times dense Earth’s means could survive unexpected trip back home posing small non zero risk people ground space junk meteors routinely veer toward crash landing Earth objects disintegrate they’re torn apart due friction pressure hit Earth’s thick atmosphere traveling thousands miles per hour Cosmos 482 object indeed Soviet reentry capsule would equipped substantial heat shield meaning “might well survive Earth atmosphere entry hit ground ” according Dr Jonathan McDowell astrophysicist astronomer Harvard Smithsonian Center Astrophysics shared predictions Cosmos 482 website risk object hitting people ground likely minimal there’s “no need major concern ” McDowell wrote “but wouldn’t want bashing head ” Vying Venus Soviet Space Research Institute IKI formed mid 1960s amid 20th century space race pitted Soviet Union chief space exploring competitor United States IKI’s Venera program sent series probes toward Venus 1970s ‘80s several surviving trip beaming data images back Earth ceasing operations Venera 8 descendent module pictured photo NASA Alex Chernov NASA Two spacecraft program V 71 670 V 71 671 launched 1972 according McDowell one made successful voyage Venus V 71 670 operated 50 minutes planet’s surface V 71 671 rocket carried Venera spacecraft “parking orbit” around Earth However vehicle failed put Venus transfer trajectory leaving stranded closer home according NASA Beginning 1960s Soviet vehicles left Earth’s orbit given Cosmos name numerical designation tracking purposes according NASA Several pieces debris created V 71 671’s failure least two already fallen orbit researchers believe one set plummet back planet week cylindrical entry capsule — Cosmos 482 — way vehicle behaved orbit “It quite dense whatever low point orbit yet didn’t decay decades ” said Marlon Sorge space debris expert federally funded research group Aerospace Corporation “So it’s clearly bowling ball ish ” though Venus probe equipped parachute vehicle service harsh environment space past decades means it’s highly unlikely parachute could deploy right time serve slow vehicle’s descent Sorge told CNN risks reentry chances Cosmos 482 causing deadly damage roughly 1 25 000 according Aerospace Corporation’s calculations Sorge said That’s much lower risk pieces space debris least defunct rocket parts reenter Earth’s atmosphere year Sorge noted many carried higher odds catastrophe Cosmos 482 object hit ground likely land 52 degrees North 52 South latitudes said Marco Langbroek lecturer space traffic expert Delft Technical University Netherlands said via email “That area encompasses several prominent landmasses countries whole Africa South America Australia USA parts Canada parts Europe parts Asia ” Langbroek said “But 70 planet water chances good end Ocean somewhere ” Langbroek said via email “Yes risk small larger risk hit lightning lifetime ” Safety first Sorge emphasized Cosmos 482 hits dry land it’s crucial bystanders attempt touch debris old spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels pose risks people property “Contact authorities ” Sorge urged “Please don’t mess ” Parker Wishik spokesperson Aerospace Corporation added 1967 Outer Space Treaty — remains primary document outlining international space law — Russia would maintain ownership surviving debris may seek recover landing global space community taken steps recent years ensure fewer spacecraft make uncontrolled crash landings back Earth Cosmos 482 vehicle highlights importance continuing efforts Wishik added “What goes must come ” said “We’re talking 50 years later another proof point importance debris mitigation making sure we’re dialogue space community put space today might affect us decades come ” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Subscribe Sign Account Settings Newsletters Topics follow
