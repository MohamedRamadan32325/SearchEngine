Newsletters earwax reveal health 28 April 2025 Share Save Jasmin Fox Skelly Share Save Emmanuel Lafont BBC Credit Emmanuel Lafont BBC Alzheimer cancer earwax contain valuable indicators person health scientists analysing chemistry hope finding new ways diagnosing diseases orange sticky probably last thing want talk polite conversation Yet earwax increasingly attracting attention scientists want use learn diseases conditions like cancer heart disease metabolic disorders type 2 diabetes proper name gloopy stuff cerumen mix secretions two types glands line outer ear canal ceruminous sebaceous glands resulting goo mixed hair dead skin flakes bodily debris reaches waxy consistency know try best think formed ear canal substance transported kind conveyer belt mechanism clinging skin cells travel inside ear outside – speed approximately one 20th millimetre every day Emmanuel Lafont BBC take months earwax that’s formed ear canal reach outer ear Credit Emmanuel Lafont BBC primary purpose earwax debated likely function keep ear canal clean lubricated However also serves effective trap preventing bacteria fungi unwelcome guests insects finding way heads far gross yet possibly due unpalatable appearance earwax somewhat overlooked researchers comes bodily secretions starting change however thanks slew surprising scientific discoveries first person earwax actually convey surprising amount information – trivial important example vast majority people European African descent wet earwax yellow orange colour sticky However 95 East Asian people dry earwax grey non sticky gene responsible producing either wet dry earwax called ABCC11 also happens responsible whether person smelly armpits Around 2 people – mostly dry earwax category – version gene means armpits odour However perhaps useful earwax related discoveries relate sticky stuff ears reveal health Important clues 1971 Nicholas L Petrakis professor medicine University California San Francisco found Caucasian African American German women USA wet earwax approximately four fold higher chance dying breast cancer Japanese Taiwanese women dry earwax recently 2010 researchers Tokyo Institute Technology took blood samples 270 female patients invasive breast cancer 273 female volunteers acted controls found Japanese women breast cancer 77 likely gene coding wet earwax healthy volunteers Nevertheless finding remains controversial large scale studies Germany Australia Italy found difference breast cancer risk people wet dry earwax although number people countries dry ear wax small established link systemic illnesses substances found earwax Take maple syrup urine disease rare genetic disorder prevents body breaking certain amino acids found food leads buildup volatile compounds blood urine giving urine distinctive odour maple syrup Emmanuel Lafont BBC Scientists hope clues earwax could lead treatments Ménière disease Credit Emmanuel Lafont BBC molecule responsible sweet smelling wee sotolone found earwax people condition means condition could diagnosed simply swabbing someone ears much simpler cheaper process genetic test Although test may even necessary earwax literally smells like maple syrup within 12 hours birth baby smell distinct lovely smell tells inborn error metabolism says Rabi Ann Musah environmental chemist Louisiana State University Covid 19 also sometimes detected earwax person earwax also tell whether type 1 type 2 diabetes Early work suggested tell someone certain form heart disease earwax although still easier diagnose condition blood tests also Ménière disease inner ear condition causes people experience vertigo hearing loss symptoms debilitating says Musah include severe nausea vertigo becomes impossible drive go places accompanied eventually suffer complete hearing loss ear afflicted Musah recently led team discovered earwax patients Ménière disease lower levels three fatty acids healthy controls first time anyone found biomarker condition usually diagnosed excluding everything else – process take years finding raises hope doctors could use earwax diagnose condition quickly future interest earwax reporter disease directed illnesses difficult diagnose using typical biological fluids like blood urine cerebral spinal fluid take long time diagnose rare says Musah like fingernails reveal health often wash feet simple test well ageing earwax makes treasure trove health information key turns waxy secretions ability reflect inner chemical reactions taking place inside body – person metabolism researchers identified 27 compounds earwax served kind fingerprint cancer diagnosis Many diseases living organisms metabolic says Nelson Roberto Antoniosi Filho professor chemistry Federal University Goiás Brazil lists diabetes cancer Parkinson Alzheimer disease examples cases mitochondria – cell organelles responsible converting lipids carbohydrates proteins energy – begin function differently healthy cells start produce different chemical substances may even stop producing others Antoniosi Filho lab discovered earwax concentrates great diversity substances biological fluids blood urine sweat tears makes lot sense lot turnover earwax says Bruce Kimball chemical ecologist Monell Chemical Senses Centre research institute based Philadelphia kind builds certainly reason think might good place capture long term snapshots changes metabolism Tricky diagnoses mind Antoniosi Filho team developing cerumenogram – diagnostic tool claim accurately predict whether person certain forms cancer based earwax 2019 study Antoniosi Filho team collected earwax samples 52 cancer patients diagnosed either lymphoma carcinoma leukaemia researchers also took earwax 50 healthy subjects analysed samples using method accurately detect presence volatile organic compounds VOCs – chemicals evaporate easily air researchers identified 27 compounds earwax served kind fingerprint cancer diagnosis words team could predict 100 accuracy whether someone cancer either lymphoma carcinoma leukaemia based concentrations 27 molecules Interestingly test could distinguish different types cancer suggesting molecules produced either response cancer cells types cancer Although cancer consists hundreds diseases metabolic point view cancer single biochemical process detected stage evaluation specific VOCs says Antoniosi Filho 2019 team identified 27 VOCs currently focusing small number exclusively produced cancer cells part unique metabolism yet unpublished work Antoniosi Filho says also shown cerumenogram able detect metabolic disturbances occur pre cancerous stages cells exhibit abnormal changes could potentially lead cancer yet cancerous Considering medicine indicates cancers diagnosed stage 1 90 cure rate conceivable success treatment much higher diagnosis pre cancer stages says Antoniosi Filho Emmanuel Lafont BBC Earwax helps trap invaders bacteria fungi enter heads Credit Emmanuel Lafont BBC research group also studying whether metabolic changes caused onset neurodegenerative diseases Parkinson Alzheimer could also picked device although work early stages future hope cerumenogram become routine clinical examination preferably every six months allows small portion earwax simultaneously diagnose diseases diabetes cancer Parkinson Alzheimer well evaluate metabolic changes resulting health conditions says Antoniosi Filho Brazil Amaral Carvalho Hospital recently adopted cerumenogram diagnostic monitoring technique cancer treatment says Antoniosi Filho Musah also hopeful research one day help people suffering Ménière disease condition currently cure first hopes validate test larger sample patients clinic producing diagnostic test could used clinicians offices currently working developing test kit similar would see counter types kits buy Covid 19 testing says Musah Understanding earwax observation three fatty acids low compared normal earwax may also provide clues investigated Musah explains might help us understand causes disease perhaps even suggest ways treated says Musah says lot foundational work still needed understand chemical profile normal healthy earwax – changes different disease states hopes one day may routinely analysed hospitals diagnose diseases much way blood Earwax really wonderful matrix use lipid rich lots diseases consequence dysregulation lipid metabolism says Musah Perdita Barran chemist professor mass spectrometry University Manchester UK study earwax specifically analyse biological molecules investigate could used diagnose diseases agrees theoretically least makes sense substance would good place look signs illness compounds find blood tend water soluble whereas earwax lipid rich substance lipids like water
