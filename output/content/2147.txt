going inside body brain health risk early death course lifetimes reaction times slowly wane one reasons athletic performance tends drop 30s onwards Scientists finding able maintain average reaction speed key indicator brain still good working order even latter decades reveal heart health overall risk early death reaction times provide window inner workings body people tend faster others even ageing effects really kick says Simon Cox professor brain cognitive ageing University Edinburgh Scotland decline reaction times probably indicates accumulation age related degradation marker tells us lot combined functioning quite lot biological systems assess reaction time comfort home One easy assessment well known experiment known ruler drop test need assistance family member friend one well ruler • Sit chair resting arm table wrist hanging edge thumb forefingers facing • Ask partner hold ruler vertically hand zero numbers start aligned thumb • Without warning partner drop ruler try catch quickly possible • distance ruler falls caught assessment reaction time Broadly speaking excellent performance equates catching ruler distance less 7 5cm average counts 7 5 15 9cm average 15 9 20 4cm average anything 20 4cm poor 28cm Population studies noticed correlation speed decline reaction times risk multiple age related illnesses addition person overall risk death – one study found significant link person reaction times likelihood death major causes – also strong relationship metric risk death specific conditions includes coronary heart disease stroke respiratory disease Getty Images person reaction times reflection cognitive physical fitness Credit Getty Images person reaction times also associated susceptibility falls losing ability live independently onset dementia However according Cox single reaction time measurement reveal much reaction speeds vary considerably one person another due factors ranging gender genetics physical fitness lifestyle habits even personality type Cox notes likely important reaction speed varies compare performance test time – example yearly intervals course decade whether starts noticeably decline Cox points ability react relies network interconnected sensory systems well see hear even smell given stimulus quickly brain process information receiving eyes ears issue signal response finally quickly nerve fibres muscles tendons enact brain telling pieces jigsaw affected ageing necessarily extent people says Cox two components reaction ruler drop test – brain ability make quick assessment dropped speed body act brain instructions catch Researchers found first component network tends break beginning midlife physical ability act brain signals brains might notice ruler let go within milliseconds – still takes body catch Pain recommends called dual task training walking turning head side side balancing one leg reciting alphabet University Colorado Boulder biomedical professor Alaa Ahmed found get older reaction times may depend heavily overall bodily health brain says may things like fast twitch muscle fibres enable physical ability respond quickly waned mitochondria – components within cells generate energy – working less well meaning less efficient moving swiftly Making faster movement costly older adults rely primarily reacting faster says Ahmed time stay relatively well brain central nervous system still function strongly latter years According Matthew Pain professor biomechanics Loughborough University UK scientists assessed measuring startle reflex ankles healthy elderly adults response loud sound results showed brain ability respond sound send move signal ankle tends remain relatively intact raw nervous system hardware healthy elderly people much worse says Pain Purely based startle reflex could still react quickly enough disqualified Olympics false start however able get blocks quickly Getty Images Measuring reaction times throughout life help track changes brain bodily health

performance time reflect combination sensory systems breaking well slowing brain decision making One study last year found loss visual sensitivity seeing responding patterns one earliest signs dementia beginning decade symptoms begin age nerve fibres brain white matter start communicate signals less efficiently resulting slower information processing says Cox decision made react nerves connect brain muscles also need good condition transmit message quickly age Improving score things either slow prevent decline happening Pain recommends called dual task training involves simultaneous movement cognitive training activities tune brain body Examples include walking turning head side side balancing one leg reciting alphabet tossing ball verbally associating words Even things like participating fitness classes via TV screen tablet help reaction times improves ability perceive stimulus respond meaningful coordinated motions says Pain Cox says many activities often linked healthy ageing continuing play sport later life learning musical instrument retirement simply keeping engaged intellectual pursuits board games knock benefits reaction times Sports performance drills require
