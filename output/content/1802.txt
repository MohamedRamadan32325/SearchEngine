Covid 19 disrupted lives people worldwide also transformed way airlines operate Changing travel advisories border restrictions pre flight health screenings documentation added new levels complexity compliance response many airlines rapidly introduced new technology innovations case Singapore Airlines even pandemic innovation central operations supporting pilots cockpit flight planning aircraft maintenance way safeguard wellbeing passengers crew essential travel currently allowed Singapore Airlines continues reshape air travel digital ingenuity board flights Safeguarding staff passengers Due rapidly changing nature pandemic Singapore Airlines uses cabin crew mobile app ensure crew prepared flight notified updates Information provided includes necessary personal protective equipment wear particular routes N95 masks protective aprons procedures follow en route destination app also allows crew members submit health declaration every flight registering temperature Singapore Airlines introduced digital dining menus aboard flights passengers view using mobile devices Hardcopy inflight dining menus removed effort reduce high contact items reduce close contact crew passengers explaining dining options Singapore Airlines also extends holistic care wellbeing staff outside aircraft cabin airline’s internal communication platform used raise awareness self care provide useful tips staff learn go Beyond pandemic “new normal” travel Singapore Airlines looking long term developments driven technology flight piloting planning Paperless pilots cockpit control tower runway paperwork largely replaced tablets mobile apps helping improve processes safety efficiency Captain Raj Kumar deputy chief pilot Boeing 777 fleet Singapore Airlines says airline started big push towards “a real paperless environment looking digital transformation initiatives” 2015 One projects involved distributing iPads Singapore Airlines pilots move towards paperless flight deck environment “Before digitisation flight briefing package 13 hour flight Singapore London would constitute 90 sheets paper – covering flight plan weather information additional operational information ” Captain Raj says weather long flight change dramatically – even paper “will really give completely accurate representation going best time ” internet connected tablet pilots review latest weather updates including information turbulence en route data recorded fed centralised server flights access ahead time Thanks technology pilots better able plan bad weather mind Captain Raj says Sudden severe turbulence encounters cause injuries much rarer decade ago Augmented vision Head displays augment primary flight displays many planes enabling pilots see exactly need without refocus what’s happening inside cockpit outside beyond windscreen displays show pilots speed navigation information right front eyes “We little pull glass combiner projects information ahead ” says Captain Raj fourth fifth generation head displays LED based laser based projectors able combine synthetic information 3D database infrared cameras show pilot detailed view outside world “Imagine flying approaching bad weather late night can’t see anything outside looks completely dark featureless naked eye look synthetic vision system able see composite image world including ground features terrain great fidelity ” says Captain Raj “This huge game changer ” advancements head displays led reduced diversions due weather well fewer operational disruptions due increased information visibility available pilots also provides better environment flight crew says Kaiser Siddiqui lead technologist systems Aerospace Technology Institute – requiring collaborative design process involving operational engineering staff understand other’s limitations strengths Enhanced training simulations Flight simulators realistic ever Virtual reality experiences developed point pilots see hands front headset interact everything inside virtual cockpit physical simulators data every aspect pilot’s actions recorded analysed used “evidence based training” Previously Singapore Airlines purely used competency based checks primarily skills test means pilots would practise fixed set drills simulator ensure could fly given set manoeuvres testing normal non normal situations engine failures Today “when pilots fly modern highly automated aeroplanes becomes important pilot first understand automatic systems recognise automatic systems behaving ” says Captain Raj Using data line operations enhanced training performance data available simulators trainers easily identify areas improvement better equip trainees resilience handle situation may happen flight aircraft tomorrow Looking ahead already concepts next generation flight decks instruments presented via digital touchscreens information consolidated multitude sensors onboard well aircraft ground sources Touchscreens replace supplement traditional instruments allowing users customise display presentation computer desktop organisations envision artificial intelligence powered flight management systems take autopilot functionality next level optimising flight paths cruise speed time arrival technology take us way point fly pilotless planes Captain Raj thinks might happen soon least next 25 years – perhaps least one pilot may required fully automated system may able cope compounding failures occur David Debney chief engineer Aerospace Technology Institute agrees “While single pilot operation may become reality 2050 timeframe unlikely fully autonomous aircraft without pilot flying commercial passenger operations timeframe partially related technology regulatory legal challenges also due manufacturer product timescales ”
