batteries stems conscientious strategy set industrial policies designed make Indeed Gregor Sebastain analyst Rhodium Group explained “Without government led industrial policy EV sector wouldn’t nearly today China ” 176 Erica Downs expert Chinese energy markets Columbia University’s Center Global Energy Policy explained “The government China went EVs ” 177 Chinese government began investing EV related technologies early 2001 EV technology introduced priority science research project China’s 10th Five Year Plan 178 However observers credit much China’s EV vision Wan Gang Chinese citizen employed Germany based fuel cell engineer Volkswagen Audi early career became China’s minister science technology 2007 Gang convinced Chinese leaders China unlikely catch global leaders ICE technologies could potentially develop NEVs leapfrog technology 179 One China’s earliest EV policy promulgations 2009 pledged 10 billion yuan 1 375 billion support industry ensuing three years extended one purchase subsidies NEVs public sector companies 13 cities 180 support China’s government federal provincial levels instrumental every stage advancing China’s EV industry initially China wished expand domestic vehicle production source economic employment growth former Chrysler executive current China auto industry analyst Bill Russo explained “The primary motivation China push EVs energy security ” notably reduce China’s need imports oil autos “Second industrial competitiveness far distant third sustainability ” 181 said Chinese leaders today bill sustainability—notably meeting country’s 2060 carbon neutral climate goal—as key rationale EV deployment one study finds EVs could help reduce China’s GHG emissions transportation sector 6 2 percent 2030 20 percent EV penetration rate total Chinese vehicle fleet 182 Indeed support China’s government federal provincial levels instrumental every stage advancing China’s EV industry setting strategic direction financing R providing industry tens billions dollars subsidies deploying charging infrastructure incentivizing EV adoption range policies government procurement consumer tax credits readily providing licenses electric gas powered vehicles Subsidies factors moved China’s EV market forward subsidies far away substantial Scott Kennedy colleagues Center Strategic International Studies CSIS estimated 2009 2023 alone China channeled 230 9 billion subsidies support domestic EV sector 183 Note 25 billion amount R investment ITIF would generally characterize market distorting subsidy long country makes enterprises nations eligible R tax credits ability win R grants CSIS found Chinese EV subsidies increased recent years estimated 120 9 billion subsidies previous three years 30 1 billion 2021 45 8 billion 2022 45 3 billion 2023 compared total 49 billion subsidies three years prior 60 7 billion subsidies 2009 2017 6 74 billion annual rate 184 2023 Chinese government extended 809 million subsidies EV battery maker CATL double 401 million provided 2022 208 9 million EVE Energy China’s fourth largest EV battery producer 185 2018 2023 Chinese government extended total 1 8 billion subsidies CATL alone CSIS’s estimates calculate five forms subsidy support China’s EV sector nationally approved buyer rebates exemption 10 percent sales tax government funding infrastructure primarily charging infrastructure R programs EV makers government procurement EVs 186 CSIS found 2009 2017 buyer’s rebates accounted 62 percent Chinese government’s support sector Chinese government reducing buyer’s rebate 2022 eliminating 2023 largest form support 87 4 percent total 39 6 billion 2023 came sales tax exemptions 187 2009 2023 alone China channeled 230 9 billion subsidies support domestic EV sector key reason Chinese subsidies EV sector like advanced technology sector pernicious enable Chinese companies sustain industries wouldn’t able subsist earn market based rates return similarly sell products cost sustain losses still able build economies scale New York Times’ Bradsher explained China automaker Nio lost 835 million April June 2023 equivalent loss 35 000 car sold 188 separate study finds China BYD’s profitability per vehicle Q3 2023 1 460 compared 5 330 Tesla noting BYD underpricing vehicles build market scale 189 Moreover aggressive strategy selling vehicles costs fails China steps rescue automaker Bradsher observed “When Nio nearly ran cash 2020 local government immediately injected 1 billion 24 percent stake state controlled bank led group lenders pump another 1 6 billion ” 190 Thus important point it’s Chinese government provincial governments providing financing subsidies Chinese EV players U China Economic Security Review Commission explained “Local governments rather central ministries played leading role deploying consumer subsidies EV purchases ” 191 matters means Chinese provincial governments played key role propping uncompetitive firms contributing overcapacity also inefficiency sector Local governments China given auto manufacturers nearly free land loans near zero interest subsidies 192 World Bank report found 2022 China’s automotive sector whole received loans interest rates roughly 2 percent half weighted average commercial industrial loans 193 CSIS’s Ilaria Mazzocco elaborated “Local governments denied subsidies EVs made provinces public officials supported local firms procuring solely manufacturers located city created highly fragmented market hundreds EV manufacturers many failed bring car production ” 194 essential point subsidies levels Chinese government contributed considerably industrial overcapacity EVs explain 200 EV car manufacturers currently operating China 195 JVs Technology Transfer Requirements Economist wrote Chinese EV subsidies “come top ransacking technology joint ventures Western carmakers South Korean battery makers ” 196 Indeed China long employed practice called “trading technology market ” conditioning foreign companies’ access Chinese markets transfer technology IP opening research production facilities China fact China introduced inaugural “Law Joint Venture Using Chinese Foreign Investment” July 1979 yielded important deals including Volkswagen 1994 signing 25 year contract build vehicles engines Shanghai 197 However time China’s approach attracting foreign direct investment thus technology transfer evolved attraction compulsion especially growing market gave increasing ability dictate detailed terms instance ITIF wrote 2011 book Innovation Economics Race Global Advantage “Ford Motor Company opened several automobile plants China condition access part joint venture Chinese auto firm Moreover Chinese government required Ford open R laboratory employing least 150 Chinese engineers ” 198 However several analysts noted “While certainly boosting production intention also transfer critical internal combustion engine ICE capability Chinese partners largely failed ” 199 Indeed recognition despite tech transfer requirements industrial upgrading efforts Chinese firms simply weren’t going catch ICE vehicles precipitated China’s embrace EVs potential alternative leapfrog technology Nevertheless Chinese tech transfer requirements forced Western automakers divulge key clean energy technologies especially early years instance New York Times wrote 2011 “The Chinese government refusing let Volt qualify subsidies totaling 19 300 car unless G agrees transfer engineering secrets one Volt’s three main technologies joint venture China Chinese automaker ” 200 said one observer noted anything reality EV industry today concept “reverse joint ventures ” Chinese firms sharing EV technology Western companies exchange market access financing 201 IP Theft Nevertheless whatever EV IP technologies Chinese entities can’t acquire enticing foreign enterprises barter away China seeks acquire state sanctioned IP theft Nicholas Eftimiades author book Chinese Intelligence Operations extensively documented Chinese industrial espionage activities four decade career wrote “Out 724 cases Chinese espionage find 500 directed toward main technologies including aerospace technologies technologies clean energy technologies automotive electric vehicle technology ” 202 fact 2020 Federal Bureau Investigation director Christopher Wray warned explicitly “China placing priority stealing electric car technology ” Chinese government “fighting generational fight surpass country economic technological leadership ” 203 Wray elaborated “We see Chinese companies stealing American intellectual property avoid hard slog innovation using compete American companies victimized—in effect cheating twice ” 204 February 2020 William Evania director National Counterintelligence Security Center singled two fields China putting priority technology theft EVs aircraft 205 Whatever IP technologies can’t acquire enticing foreign enterprises trade away China seeks acquire state sanctioned IP theft Indeed U EV companies feeling brunt coordinated Chinese efforts pilfer technology September 2023 Tesla sued Chinese chip designer auto parts maker Bingling infringing IP stealing trade secrets related integrated circuits e semiconductors Tesla uses vehicles 206 June 2024 Klaus Pflugbell Canadian German national living China pleaded guilty conspiring sell trade secrets EV batteries belonged leading U based EV company Chinese entities 207 Favoring Domestic Enterprises Chinese government long worked favor domestic foreign suppliers automotive supply chains instance China’s “Made China 2025” strategy released 2015 stipulates 70 percent one million plus EVs plug hybrids sold annually China homegrown brands 2020 target set 2025 80 percent market estimated three million vehicles 208 recently March 2024 Chinese government reportedly asked EV makers BYD Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd sharply increase purchases local auto chipmakers part campaign reduce reliance Western imports boost China’s domestic semiconductor industry 209 China’s Ministry Industry Information Technology MITI directly instructed Chinese automakers avoid foreign semiconductors possible 210 Ministry previously “set informal target automakers source fifth chips locally 2025 ” 211 Policies aforementioned Chinese policies support EV EV batteries sectors innovation mercantilist nature certainly policies legitimately smartly designed promote innovation EVs batteries adoption technologies instance China directed estimated 25 billion toward R activities EV industry 2009 2023 212 ITIF written countries electing compete advanced technology industries constructive policies investments R education produce genuine innovations benefit humankind 213 Certainly Chinese policymakers put thumb scale electric opposed ICE vehicle adoption among consumers instance Shanghai authorities long offered EV owners license plates cost 214 many Chinese cities EVs restricted traffic control measures policies limit number cars road prescribed period allowed use bus lanes offered free parking 215 China also established world’s largest public charging infrastructure network public charger stock reaching 1 million—51 percent global total—and total rated power exceeding 56 gigawatts 2022 216 Several Chinese cities established widely distributed public charging networks urban cores virtually 100 percent EV drivers find public charger within 20 minutes driving time 217 However observers note China considerable way go EV charging coverage rural even suburban areas “highways particular weak spot China’s public charging infrastructure network” highway public charger density one sixth Norway 218 Active government procurement EVs also played important role creating market driving adoption EVs China 2014 China required central government well cities public organizations least 30 percent vehicle fleet consist EVs 2016 goal increased 50 percent 2016 219 One study finds public sector entities across China’s provinces already procured 550 000 EVs end 2020 220 CSIS estimates China directed 18 billion government procurement EVs 2009 2023 221 Chinese regulators also appear predisposed permit innovative automotive technologies reach roadways quickly instance Bradsher wrote “In United States Tesla’s called Autopilot feature subject series government safety investigations China regulators general public tended see technology safer relying human drivers ” 222 Analysis Chinese Policies Supporting EV Sector China’s success EVs viewed beneficial global economic system global concerns mitigating global warming Economist wrote “Now China’s carmakers enjoying astonishing rise stokes fears another ruinous shock fact successes
