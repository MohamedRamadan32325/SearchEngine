activity around cluster sunspots VTF KIS NSF NSO AURA Sign CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter Explore universe news fascinating discoveries scientific advancements CNN — newly released image sun captured world’s largest solar telescope shows surface nearest star unprecedented detail shedding light fiery complexity image first taken US National Science Foundation Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope’s new Visible Tunable Filter VTF instrument build closer ever three dimensional view what’s happening sun’s surface according news release close reveals cluster continent size dark sunspots near center sun’s inner atmosphere scale 6 2 miles 10 kilometers per pixel blemishes mark areas intense magnetic activity solar flares coronal mass ejections CMEs likely occur Coronal mass ejections large clouds ionized gas called plasma magnetic fields erupt sun’s outer atmosphere Detailed images one taken early December pose important way scientists learn predict potentially dangerous solar weather said Friedrich Woeger NSF Inouye Solar Telescope instrument program scientist email “A solar storm 1800s Carrington Event reportedly energetic caused fires telegraph stations ” Woeger said “We need understand physical drivers phenomena affect technology ultimately lives ” NASA Johns Hopkins APL Related article History making probe achieves closest ever approach sun energetic outbursts sun interact planet’s electromagnetic field causing disturbances key infrastructure electrical power grids satellite powered communication networks explained sun goes periods high low magnetic activity 11 year cycle October scientists National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration NASA international Solar Cycle Prediction Panel announced sun reached peak activity called solar maximum peak sun’s magnetic poles flip sunspots appear surface maximum expected last several months it’s fitting time Inouye Solar Telescope ramping instrument testing spectacular images sun’s dynamic surface closer look sun Like boiling soup stove heat escapes core sun rises surface fluid motions said Mark Miesch research scientist Cooperative Institute Research Environmental Sciences University Colorado Boulder Miesch involved research Sunspots like “magnetic plugs ” tangles star’s complex magnetic fields prevent heat reaching surface Miesch said reason sunspots emit less light areas sun appear darker images cooler surroundings Nevertheless sunspots “still hotter oven Earth ” added apparent texture sun comes varying densities temperatures within surface layers similar onion “tuning” different wavelengths colors like radio tuner VTF offers way probe various layers observe happening Miesch said words image personal camera uses light contains multiple wavelengths time VTF type imaging spectro polarimeter filters measurable wavelengths one one accomplish filtering instrument uses etalon — two glass plates separated mere microns NASA Joseph DePasquale STScI Related article largest storm solar system moving unexpectedly scientists say “The principle unlike noise canceling headphones two waves similar wavelength travel intersecting path interact either cancel reinforce ” Woeger said “Light waves ‘trapped’ two plates interfere distance plates selects exact ‘colors’ light passed ones cancel ” seconds powerful instrument captures hundreds images different filters combines three dimensional snapshot Researchers use resulting views study temperature pressure velocity magnetic field structure diﬀerent layers solar atmosphere “Seeing first spectral scans surreal moment something instrument telescope achieve way ” said Dr Stacey Sueoka senior optical engineer National Solar Observatory statement Near summit Maui’s Haleakalā volcanic mountain NSF Daniel K Inouye Solar Telescope set pave way deeper understanding home star NSF NSO AURA What’s next horizon imaging spectro polarimeter represents culmination decade’s worth development Located NSF’s National Solar Observatory top Maui’s 10 000 foot 3 000 meter Haleakalā volcanic mountain VTF spans multiple stories Inouye Solar Telescope VTF designed built Institute Solar Physics Germany instrument’s parts shipped across Atlantic Pacific oceans reassembled — like “ship bottle ” Woeger said image sketches Kepler book 1609 Phaenomenon Singulare Seu Mercurius Sole Thomae Scheueri Lipisiae Johannes Kepler Related article Johannes Kepler thought sketched Mercury orbiting across sun actually captured solved solar mystery team expects tool fully operational ready use 2026 “The significance technological achievement one could easily argue VTF Inouye Solar Telescope’s heart finally beating forever place ” said Dr Matthias Schubert VTF project scientist Institute Solar Physics statement solar telescope among several recent efforts scientists better understand sun stormy weather patterns including Solar Orbiter joint mission European Space Agency NASA launched 2020 NASA’s Parker Solar Probe first spacecraft “touch” sun Ad
