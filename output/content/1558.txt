electric cars emerging newer generations vehicles progressively become available earlier adopters switch upgrade Second hand markets critical foster mass market adoption especially new electric cars remain expensive used ones become cheaper ICE vehicles – buying second hand often primary method acquiring car emerging advanced economies – similar pattern emerge electric vehicles estimated eight ten EU citizens buy car second hand share even higher – around 90 – among low middle income groups Similarly United States seven ten vehicles sold second hand 17 lower income households buy new car major electric car markets reach maturity used electric cars becoming available resale estimates suggest 2023 market size used electric cars amounted nearly 800 000 China 400 000 United States 450 000

cars priced around CNY 75 000 average 2023 USD 11 000 recent years resale value 8 electric cars increasing Europe resale value battery electric cars sold 12 months steadily increased 2017 2022 period surpassing powertrains standing 70 mid 2022 resale value battery electric cars sold 36 months stood 40 2017 since closing gap powertrains reaching around 55 mid 2022 result many factors including higher prices new electric cars improving technology allowing vehicles batteries retain greater value time increasing demand second hand electric cars Similar trends observed China High low resale values important implications development second hand electric car markets contributions transition road transport electrification High resale values primarily benefit consumers new cars retain value initial purchase carmakers many consumers attracted possibility reselling car years thereby fostering demand newer models High resale values also benefit leasing companies seek minimise depreciation resell years Leasing companies significant impact second hand markets large volumes vehicles shorter period three years compared 3 5 years private household impact markets new cars also considerable leasing companies accounted 20 new cars sold Europe 2022 Overall resale value electric cars par higher ICE equivalents contributes supporting demand new electric cars near term however combination high prices new electric cars high resale values could hinder widespread adoption used EVs among mass market consumers seeking affordable cars cases policy support help bridge gap second hand ICE prices International trade used electric cars emerging markets expected increase EV stock ages advanced markets likely used EVs traded internationally assuming global standards enable technology

major second hand electric car markets Japanese vehicles traditionally Russia New Zealand 60 combined Russia’s invasion Ukraine 2022 second hand trade conventional cars Japan Russia jumped sharply following halt operations local OEMs Russia trade quickly restricted Japanese government thereby bringing price second hand cars Japan New Zealand local vehicle assembly manufacturing facilities reason many cars entering New Zealand used imports 2023 nearly 20 electric cars entered New Zealand used imports compared 50 overall car market emerging economies local policies play important role promoting limiting trade flows used cars case ICE vehicles example countries e g Bolivia Côte d’Ivoire Peru limit maximum age used car imports prevent dumping highly polluting cars countries e g Brazil Colombia Egypt India South Africa banned used car imports entirely protect domestic manufacturing industries ICE vehicles policy measures either help hinder import used electric cars setting emission standards imported used cars Importing countries also need simultaneously support roll charging infrastructure avoid problems access like reported Sri Lanka incentive scheme significantly increased imports used EVs 2018 median age vehicle imports tends increase GDP per capita country decreases African countries median age imports 15 years Beyond timeframe electric cars may require specific servicing extend lifetime support availability second hand markets electric cars important develop strategies technical capacity business models swap old batteries used vehicles Today many countries import ICE vehicles including EMDEs already servicing capacity place extend lifetimes used ICE vehicles used EVs hand typically fewer parts electric powertrains ICE ones parts even durable Battery recycling capacity also needed given importing country likely imported EV eventually reaches end life Including end life considerations policy making today help mitigate risk longer term environmental harm could result accumulation obsolete EVs associated waste EMDEs Policy choices mature markets also impact possible trade flows example current policy framework European Union circularity EV batteries may prevent EVs EV batteries leaving European Union brings energy security advantages might limit reuse regard advanced economies EMDEs strengthen co operation facilitate second hand trade ensuring adequate end life strategies example could incentives allowances associated extended vehicle lifetimes via use second hand markets internationally recycling long recycling
