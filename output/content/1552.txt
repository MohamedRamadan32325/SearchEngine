Century Thomas Edison invented battery unusual quirk producing hydrogen 120 years later battery coming Traveling gravelly road West Orange New Jersey electric car sped pedestrians clearly surprised vehicle roomy interior travelled twice speed conventional vehicles overtook stirring dust perhaps tickled noses horses pulling carriages steadily along street early 1900s driver particular car Thomas Edison electric cars novelty neighborhood relied heavy cumbersome lead acid batteries Edison outfitted car new type battery hoped would soon powering vehicles throughout country nickel iron battery Building work Swedish inventor Ernst Waldemar Jungner first patented nickel iron battery 1899 Edison sought refine battery use automobiles Edison claimed nickel iron battery incredibly resilient could charged twice fast lead acid batteries even deal place Ford Motors produce purportedly efficient electric vehicle nickel iron battery kinks work larger widely used lead acid batteries expensive Also charged would release hydrogen considered nuisance could dangerous century later engineers would discover nickel iron battery something diamond rough Unfortunately time Edison refined prototype electric vehicles way favour fossil fuel powered vehicles could go longer distances needing refuel recharge Edison deal Ford Motors fell wayside though battery continued used certain niches railroad signalling bulky size hindrance century later engineers would rediscover nickel iron battery something diamond rough investigated answer enduring challenge renewable energy smoothing intermittent nature clean energy sources like wind solar hydrogen considered worrisome byproduct could turn one useful things batteries used dangerous quirk Edison battery turned remarkably useful Credit Alamy Speeding forward mid 2010s research team Delft University Technology Netherlands happened upon use nickel iron battery based hydrogen produced electricity passes battery it’s recharged undergoes chemical reaction releases hydrogen oxygen team recognised reaction reminiscent one used release hydrogen water known electrolysis looked like chemistry says Fokko Mulder leader Delft University research team water splitting reaction one way hydrogen produced use fuel – entirely clean fuel provided energy used drive reaction renewable source Nickel iron batteries extremely durable Edison proved early electric car known last upwards 40 years Mulder team knew nickel iron battery’s electrodes capable splitting water surprised see electrodes started higher energy storage hydrogen produced words became better battery used electrolyser also surprised see well electrodes held electrolysis excessively tax degrade traditional batteries course rather content energy efficiency appeared good says Mulder reaching levels 80 90 Conventional electrolysers employed convert renewables hydrogen Mulder hopes battolyser could efficiently cheaply Credit Getty Images Mulder dubbed creation battolyser hope discovery help solve two major challenges renewable energy energy storage batteries full production clean fuel hear discussions batteries one hand hydrogen hand says Mulder always kind competition two sets directions basically need Renewable value One biggest challenges renewable energy sources wind solar unpredictable intermittent solar example surplus energy produced daytime summertime night winter months supply dwindles Conventional batteries based lithium store energy short term they’re fully charged release excess could overheat degrade nickel iron battolyser hand remains stable fully charged point transition making hydrogen instead Nickel iron batteries resilient able withstand undercharging overcharging better batteries says John Barton research associate School Mechanical Electrical Manufacturing Engineering Loughborough University UK also researches battolysers hydrogen production battolyser adds multi day even inter seasonal energy storage Besides creating hydrogen nickel iron batteries useful traits first foremost unusually low maintenance extremely durable Edison proved early electric car known last upwards 40 years metals needed make battery – nickel iron – also common say cobalt used make conventional batteries means battolyser could another possible role renewable energy helping become profitable Like industry renewable energy prices fluctuate based supply demand bright sunny day might abundance power solar lead glut dip price energy sold battolyser however could help smooth peaks troughs electricity prices high discharge battery electricity price low charge battery make hydrogen says Mulder battolyser one way help balance supply demand renewable energy sources like solar wind Credit Alamy battolyser alone regard traditional alkaline electrolysers coupled batteries perform function widespread hydrogen producing industry Mulder thinks battolyser thing less money longer thanks durability system something making battolyser backers hopeful hydrogen direct product battolyser useful substances generated ammonia methanol typically easier store transport battolyser place ammonia plant would run constantly would need less manpower reducing operating costs maintenance costs thus producing ammonia cheapest way sustainable green manner says Hans Vrijenhoef chief executive Proton Ventures invested Mulder battolyser Scaling Right largest battolyser existence 15kW 15kWh enough battery capacity long term hydrogen storage power 1 5 households larger version 30kW 30kWh battolyser works Magnum power station Eemshaven Netherlands provide enough hydrogen satisfy needs power station undergone rigorous testing aim scale distribute battolyser green energy producers solar wind farms Ultimately battolyser proponents hope reach gigawatt scale – equivalent power generated around 400 utility scale wind turbines Though well scaling Barton sees role smaller battolysers could help supply energy mini grids used remote communities live main power grids Edison laboratory New Jersey birthplace many inventions gained popularity lifetime Credit Alamy fact battolyser electrodes made relatively cheap common metals may help unlike lithium nickel iron create large quantities water waste mined linked significant environmental degradation Still Mulder Barton see hurdles overcome terms efficiency capacity battolyser would really benefit increased power capacity battery reduced internal resistance says Barton Internal resistance opposition flow current battery higher internal resistance lower efficiency Improving something Mulder team working Much potential battolyser hiding plain sight ever since Thomas Edison first began experimenting nickel iron battery turn 20th Century may wrong believing battery would supplant vehicles road nickel iron battery may yet play role replacing fossil fuels broadly helping hasten transition renewables emissions travel took report story 0kg CO2 digital emissions story
