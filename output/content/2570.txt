Timperley examines latest science ocean clean ups April 20 2010 blowout caused huge explosion offshore drilling rig operated BP Gulf Mexico Eleven people killed Two days later rig collapsed Oil began seeping sea continued flow almost three months Deepwater Horizon disaster among lamented environmental catastrophes past century hard comprehend incredibly huge spill world largest ever marine oil spill releasing estimated 4 9 million barrels crude oil 779 million litres 300 Olympic swimming pools worth million seabirds killed outright human health socioeconomic effects still felt today North Sea oil spill 10 March 2025 two ships collided North Sea oil tanker MV Stena Immaculate cargo ship called Solong company owns Immaculate said ship load – jet fuel – leaking sea Follow BBC News live page collision BP rig operator Transocean several government agencies immediately tried limit damage BP chief executive saying company determined everything power contain spill Booms deployed try contain oil skimmer ships nibbled edges widening slick fires set try burn sea surface Various devices deployed deep surface try contain capture oil BP also began spray oil enormous amounts dispersants sea surface 1 5km 0 9 miles underwater oil gushing wellhead However thought measures recovered dispersed around third spilled oil BP spill sparked huge amount research oil spills impacts 14 years hope better measures another oil spill occur knew immediately would ecologically economically disastrous – Jeffrey Short Jeffrey Short expert oil spills retired scientist US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Noaa working Oceana marine conservation organisation BP spill occurred colleague told spill lunchtime felt sick knew immediately would ecologically economically disastrous would wreck tens thousands people lives would dominate professional life next several years says proved true Oil spills third largest source oil sea land based runoff largely cities vehicles natural oil seeps problem spills course sheer volume oil enters sea means oil spills – especially big ones – much much dangerous per unit oil released says Short spill since surpassed Deepwater Horizon sheer volume Noaa responds 150 oil spills every year last month oil began spewing submerged oil tanker least two sunken vessels Manila Bay Philippines hit monsoon rains Typhoon Gaemi Another oil tanker hit projectiles Yemen Houthi movement remains precarious position Red Sea However number oil spills tankers today far lower 1970s due improved standards oil spills occur first step control source whether ship pipeline leaking well says Doug Helton regional supervisor emergency response division Noaa Office Response Restoration second priority recovering oil sea major priority avoid oil reaching shoreline damage Shoreline cleanups last days years depending type oil severity contamination says Helton Spilt oil tends spread quickly thin layer sea surface Within days centimetres thick layers become film millimetre less spread drifting patches wide area Efforts scoop oil sea surface therefore offer diminishing returns time goes Floating oil spreads quickly limited window time – days – sea tools effective says Helton Getty Images Workers attempt clean oil contaminated beach Grand Isle Louisiana June 2010 Credit Getty Images Hundreds skimmers deployed clean BP Deep Horizon spill Skimmers boats scoop spilled oil water surface usually slick first surrounded floating booms keep spreading various ways – example suck oil like vacuum cleaner others use oil attracting conveyor belts gravity carry spilled oil reservoir hopes time skimmers could pick oil like lawnmower cutting grass proved overblown recovered estimated 3 oil sea oil may spread rapidly skimming vessels trying capture oil says Helton Going faster easy option bow wave ship push oil away satellite photos BP disaster speak volumes says Short see half dozen surface skimming boats sea surface next boat look quite large quite effective satellite realise nearly negligible effect size spill fact 2020 review 30 large offshore oil spills found 2 6 oil recovered using mechanical methods like skimmers Short says mechanical recovery improved recent decades better booms corral oil better systems remove sea surface even improvements mechanical methods much impact large spill says recent years plethora studies reports emerged looking different ways soak oil spills laser treated cork textiles based leaves graphene magnets even hair fur mostly rely oil attracting water hating properties material various forms oil attracting sponges particularly common solution difficulty handling oil soaked materials means techniques typically useful small spills Noaa BBC Best estimates happened oil BP Deepwater Horizon disaster Credit Noaa BBC Guihua Yu professor materials science University Texas Austin team began considering whether new material lab working could used help clean oil spills says surprised lack focus innovative materials could used practice One central problem says used non continuous way requiring processing remove oil material used Yu team landed solution thinks could help 2023 paper lab developed prototype collection speed 10 times faster current clean rates lab produced super oleophilic gel capable 99 separation oil water used cover mesh filter also designed continuous roller system Yu says would attached front ship conveyer belt picks oil water surface rolls round beside induction heater heats oil detaching allowing drip collector middle roller freed directly reused rolls water important innovation work probably higher throughput says Yu personally felt unique different conventional invention far tested small motor oil spill lake China using metre scale prototype Yu says conversations industry potentially interested scaling overall costs believes would reasonable However admits current design address bow wave issue oil pushed away ship noting balance collection bow wave worthy investigation Short says large spills require day clean movement oil night operations usually carried always limit efficacy collecting oil sea surface following day oil must first located response equipment effectively deployed says large spills especially response equipment limited challenges may limit amount recoverable oil less 10 initial spill volume Still improvements made tracking oil Noaa uses drones satellites help find track oil spills tools mapping coordination advanced Undersea manned autonomous tools tap sunken vessels extract oil also developed since Deepwater Horizon spill says Helton Getty Images worker pulls oil soaked absorbent boom Deepwater Horizon spill Credit Getty Images Burning another controversial way remove floating oil sea estimated 5 BP oil spill burnt surface Burning requires concentrating oil sea surface least 2 3mm – relatively thick oil spill also requires quick action lucky weather conditions Exxon Valdez oil spill Prince William Sound Alaska 1989 storm dispersed oil wide area film thin catch alight Improved boom designs better corral oil improved effectiveness burning years says Short successful burning also problems environment human health form air pollution impacts air pollution workers attempting clean BP oil spill still investigated today major 2022 study found workers involved cleaning spill 60 likely diagnosed asthma experience asthma symptoms one three years spill compared work cleanup Aggressive cleanup environments cause harm oil – Doug Helton Burning culprit air pollution evaporation oil also highly toxic another controversial way try dissipate impacts oil spills dispersants Deepwater Horizon disaster BP sprayed roughly 1 84 million gallons 8 37 million litres dispersant Corexit surface deep water column – largest volume dispersant ever used oil spill Dispersants work breaking oil smaller droplets mix water helps degrade removes surface tends damage especially diving seabirds surfacing marine mammals turtles young fish needs added quickly oil spills Little known exactly quantity dispersant would affect environment BP spill hope would stop oil reaching shoreline habitats sheer volume used widely criticised largely ineffective well harmful environment humans thought 8 oil dispersed using Corexit Short view prior knowledge oil spills meant Deepwater Horizon spill quite certain advance continued application dispersants parts oil slick already emulsified waste time beyond first days shows public something Environmentalists scientists term kinds reactions oil spills – response theatre describes companies responsible spill focus seen something spill necessarily best thing researchers however say dispersants relatively effective may helped avoid air pollution getting rid oil 2019 report US National Academies found dispersants help cope oil spills circumstances limitations research make hard make conclusions whether improves human health aspect compared using dispersants Wade Jeffrey Philippe Lebaron Sabine Matallana Surget position experiments test response microbial communities oil Corexit sunlight Credit Wade Jeffrey Still counterintuitive may sound occassions interventions could worse option leaving oil spill alone many places ocean microbes developed eat oil seeping naturally environment bacteria fungi munch away oil spills – albeit relatively slowly others – impacted chemicals dispersants process could disrupted Bioremediation – adding nutrients encourage oil degrading bacteria – long history use oil spills scientists still beginning understanding complex interactions microbial communities chemical dispersants well interact environmental factors like temperature sunlight Research example shown sunlight levels impact oil degradation different microbes differently study published 2024 became first use advanced microbiology technique look interactions Rather look DNA microbes previous studies done scientists examined protein expression microbes waters coast Florida – technique usually used medical clinical science Using techniques show far detail looking DNA alone says Sabine Matallana Surget associate professor environmental molecular microbiology University Stirling Scotland led study similar study humans example would able tell lunch tracking enzymes involved food digestion like decline oil sight Colombia plans keep oil coal ground health impact living near fossil gas leak team found Corexit induces high expression proteins involved oxidative stress oil degrading bacteria never seen many proteins involving DNA damage repair introduce Corexit microbial community says Matallana Surget sunlight also increased toxicity Corexit oil experiment creating double pill effect adds team plan conduct similar experiments places natural seepages oil different microbes temperature sunlight levels another oil spill one places Matallana Surget says findings could inform optimum level Corexit use particular location maximum oil recovery hoping near future accident somewhere else would able say Well listen apply Corexit region much maybe concentration Dispersants intervention oil spills caused concern found lengthy research aggressive cleanup environments cause harm oil says Helton Marshes sheltered intertidal habitats example often treated carefully high pressure hot water washing used clean ecologically sensitive shorelines Prince William Sound Alaska 1989 Exxon Valdez spill example sterilised beaches inadvertently killing bacteria well larger animals Research shown areas cleaned hot water recovered faster treated sites Cleaning seabirds Oil soaked birds often one immediate visible impact oil spills depressing survival rates – lower 1 – led experts German biologist Silvia Gaus argue euthanasia humane option wildlife rescuers say rates may improving learn better animal husbandry allowing rest hydration embarking stressful process removing oil feathers Guidelines also developed cleaning turtles marine mammals spill like Deepwater Horizon happened today says Matallana Surget reaction would completely different huge conversations around happened applying tonnes chemical idea going environment think nobody part world would Ultimately since spills hard clean avoiding happening first place remains important thing Prevention going fruitful line approach says Short Continuing implement safety measures especially vigilant problem standards expensive maintain says years go without spill tend start slipping Major changes made US regulations governing offshore oil gas operations well advances preventing blowouts first place New performance measures enforcement mechanisms introduced improve pipeline safety However also new potential risks oil spills deeper drilling ageing infrastructure transport new types oil different routes Arctic climate impacts like sea level rise intense frequent storms report released BP September 2010 concluded decisions made multiple companies work teams including BP others contributed spill unprecedented costs – 65bn £49bn – BP Deepwater Horizon acted incentive companies maintain vigilance avoid future disasters says Short think really got lot attention industry trivial operating expense write business usual BP also quickly announced 500m £380m 10 year research programme credited galvanising advancement oil spill
