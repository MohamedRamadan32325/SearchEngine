increase data center power demand Share share average ChatGPT query needs nearly 10 times much electricity process Google search difference lies coming sea change US Europe world large consume power — much cost years data centers displayed remarkably stable appetite power even workloads mounted pace efficiency gains electricity use slows AI revolution gathers steam Goldman Sachs Research estimates data center power demand grow 160 2030 present data centers worldwide consume 1 2 overall power percentage likely rise 3 4 end decade US Europe increased demand help drive kind electricity growth hasn’t seen generation Along way carbon dioxide emissions data centers may double 2022 2030 much power data centers consume series three reports Goldman Sachs Research analysts lay US European global implications spike electricity demand isn’t demand data meager recent past fact data center workloads nearly tripled 2015 2019 period though data centers’ demand power remained flattish 200 terawatt hours per year part data centers kept growing efficient used power drew according Goldman Sachs Research reports led Carly Davenport Alberto Gandolfi Brian Singer since 2020 efficiency gains appear dwindled power consumed data centers risen AI innovations boost computing speed faster ramp electricity use widening use AI still imply increase technology’s consumption power single ChatGPT query requires 2 9 watt hours electricity compared 0 3 watt hours Google search according International Energy Agency Goldman Sachs Research estimates overall increase data center power consumption AI order 200 terawatt hours per year 2023 2030 2028 analysts expect AI represent 19 data center power demand tandem expected rise data center carbon dioxide emissions represent “social cost” 125 140 billion present value analysts believe “Conversations technology companies indicate continued confidence driving energy intensity less confidence meeting absolute emissions forecasts account rising demand ” write expect substantial investments tech firms underwrite new renewables commercialize emerging nuclear generation capabilities AI may also provide benefits accelerating innovation — example health care agriculture education emissions reducing energy efficiencies US electricity demand set surge last decade US power demand growth roughly zero even though population economic activity increased Efficiencies helped one example LED light drives lower power use set change 2022 2030 demand power rise roughly 2 4 Goldman Sachs Research estimates — around 0 9 percent points figure tied data centers kind spike power demand hasn’t seen US since early years century stoked partly electrification industrial reshoring also AI Data centers use 8 US power 2030 compared 3 2022 US utilities need invest around 50 billion new generation capacity support data centers alone addition analysts expect incremental data center power consumption US drive around 3 3 billion cubic feet per day new natural gas demand 2030 require new pipeline capacity built Europe needs 1 trillion plus prepare power grid AI past 15 years Europe’s power demand severely hit sequence shocks global financial crisis covid pandemic energy crisis triggered war Ukraine also suffered due slower expected pick electrification ongoing de industrialization European economy result since 2008 peak electricity demand cumulatively declined nearly 10 Going forward 2023 2033 thanks expansion data centers acceleration electrification Europe’s power demand could grow 40 perhaps even 50 according Goldman Sachs Research moment around 15 world’s data centers located Europe 2030 power needs data centers match current total consumption Portugal Greece Netherlands combined Data center power demand rise two kinds European countries analysts write first sort cheap abundant power nuclear hydro wind solar sources Nordic nations Spain France second kind include countries large financial services tech companies offer tax breaks incentives attract data centers latter category includes Germany UK Ireland Europe oldest power grid world keeping new data centers electrified require investment analysts expect nearly €800
